    "description": "Beaks. Inside the “Chinese lantern” of the calyx is a capsule that slowly turns from green to beige-yellow, and then opens to drop the seeds. Shortly before opening, capsule often becomes a little translucent and the brown-burgundy color of the seeds becomes visible. Peel back the papery lantern to check. Collect when the capsule is yellow-beige or translucent. Leaves are opposite pairs, like ladder rungs.",
