    "description": "Ballistic. Elaiosomes. Pods start out nodding, then raise their heads up to the sky, split open into 3rds, and finally shoot their seeds away. Collect when heads are aimed between the horizon & the sky. Most violet species have multiple rounds of seeds: initially from open flowers (chasmogamous), but later they form flowers that never open and self-pollinate (cleistogamous) to produce additional seeds. Sow fresh.",
