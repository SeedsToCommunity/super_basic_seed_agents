    "description": "Ballistic. The blue-purple petals drop, revealing hard capsules tucked in the center of the 5 sepals. Capsules swell & turn green-beige, before splitting into 3 pieces & shooting the dark seeds away. Sepals often reflex (peel backwards) like a star shortly before catapulting. After flowers start to fade, cover with mesh hoods to capture seeds",
