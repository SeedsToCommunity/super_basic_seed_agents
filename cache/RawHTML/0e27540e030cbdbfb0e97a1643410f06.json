It produces only basal\r\nleaves that are about 3-5\" wide and across. Each of these basal leaves\r\nis wrapped around the stalk of a single flower (sometimes two stalks\r\nare produced) as the flower begins to bloom. The basal leaves continue\r\nto unfold to their fullest extent as the flowers wither away. Each\r\nbasal leaf is oval-orbicular in outline and palmate-reticulately\r\nveined, with 5-9 major\r\nlobes and several minor lobes along the undulating margins. The\r\npalmate-reticulate\r\nvenation is fairly prominent and provides the rather succulent leaves\r\nwith a wrinkly appearance, especially on their lower surfaces. The\r\ncolor of the\r\nleaves on the upper surface is light green, sometimes with greyish or\r\nbluish tints, while the lower surface is whitish green. The terete\r\npetioles are about 4\" long and rather stout. The foliage of this plant\r\nis glabrous and glaucous. </font></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"><img style=\"width: 600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Flowering Plants\" src=\"../photos/bloodroot1.jpg\"></font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Tahoma\">The flowering stalk is\r\nterete, stout,\r\nglabrous, and sometimes slightly reddish, terminating in a single large\r\nflower. This stalk is about 3-4\" tall when the flower begins to bloom.\r\nThe flower is about 1�&#8211;3\" across, consisting of 8-16 white petals, a\r\ngreen oval pistil, and numerous stamens with prominent yellow anthers.\r\nThe pistil has a pale yellow stigma at its apex. There are 2 light\r\ngreen sepals that are nearly as long as the petals, but they fall off\r\nthe flowering stalk as soon as the flower begins to bloom. The blooming\r\nperiod occurs from early to mid-spring, lasting about 2 weeks. Each\r\nflower remains in bloom for only 1 or 2 days (when it is sunny),\r\nproducing a fragrant scent. Afterwards, each flower is replaced by a\r\nseed capsule that becomes enlarged and eventually turns yellow,\r\nsplitting open to release its seeds. The root\r\nsystem consists of thick reddish rhizomes with coarse fibrous roots.\r\nBoth the foliage and the rhizomes contain an acrid reddish juice. This\r\nplants often forms vegetative colonies.</font></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"><img style=\"width: 420px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Close-up of Leaf\" src=\"../photos/bloodroot2.jpg\"></font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Tahoma\"><b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Cultivation:</font></b>\r\nDuring early to mid-spring, this plant should have access to\r\nsome sunlight, otherwise the flowers may fail to open. After the trees\r\nbegin to form leaves later in the spring, considerable shade is\r\ntolerated. The soil should be fertile and loamy, with average moisture\r\nlevels (by woodland standards). The foliage is not affected by disease\r\nsignificantly, although it will gradually wither away as the summer\r\nprogresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Range &amp; Habitat:</font></b>\r\nBloodroot is a common plant that occurs in most counties of Illinois\r\n(see <a href=\"../maps/mp_bloodroot.htm\" target=\"map\" onclick=\"window.open('','map','resizable=no,scrollbars=no,height=463,width=275,left=100,screenX=100,top=50,screenY=50')\">Distribution\r\nMap</a>), where it is native. Habitats include rich deciduous\r\nwoodlands, wooded slopes, edges of bluffs, shaded ravines, banks of\r\nrivers in wooded areas, and areas along woodland paths.</font></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"><img style=\"width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Close-up of Flowers\" src=\"../photos/bloodroot3.jpg\"></font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Tahoma\"><b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Faunal\r\nAssociations:</font></b>\r\nThe pollen of the flowers attracts various kinds of bees, including\r\nhoneybees, bumblebees, little carpenter bees (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ceratina spp.</span>),\r\nHalictid bees (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Halictus\r\nspp.</span>,<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\r\nLasioglossum spp.</span>), and Andrenid bees (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Andrena spp.</span>).\r\nOther insects that visit the flowers include Syrphid flies and beetles,\r\nwhich feed on the pollen (or search vainly for nectar). An aphid, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Linosiphon sanguinarium</span>,\r\nsucks plant juices from the leaf undersides. The seeds of Bloodroot are\r\ndistributed by ants because of their fleshy appendages. This is a\r\ncommon method of seed distribution for woodland wildflowers, as wind\r\nspeeds are greatly reduced in wooded areas. The foliage and rhizomes\r\ncontain an acrid reddish juice and they are toxic. Consequently, this\r\nplant is not often eaten by mammalian herbivores, although White-Tailed\r\nDeer browse sparingly on the succulent leaves.</font></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"><img style=\"width: 560px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Flowering Plants\" src=\"../photos/bloodroot4.jpg\"></font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Tahoma\"><b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Photographic\r\nLocation:</font></b>\r\nA partially-shaded flower garden near Busey Woods in Urbana, Illinois.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Comments:</font></b>\r\nBloodroot is one of the spring ephemerals of deciduous woodlands. It\r\nhas very showy flowers and unusual-looking, but attractive, foliage.\r\nUnfortunately, the flowers are relatively short-lived. Across\r\ndifferent localities, there are significant variations in this plant,\r\ninvolving such characteristics as the number of petals and size of the\r\nflowers, and the appearance of the foliage. On rare occasions, light\r\npink flowers are produced. The Amerindians created a red dye from the\r\njuice of the rhizomes. The juice of plants in this genus possesses\r\nanti-bacterial properties with possible pharmaceutical applications,\r\nincluding an anti-plaque mouthwash.</font></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"><a href=\"../woodland_index.htm#bloodroot\">Return</a></font></p>\r\n<font face=\"Tahoma\"><br>\r\n</font>\r\n</body></html>"}
