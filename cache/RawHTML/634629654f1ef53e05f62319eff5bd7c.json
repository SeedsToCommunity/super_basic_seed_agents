The\r\nstem is light green or slightly reddish green, glabrous, and rather\r\nsucculent. The basal leaves and the pair of cauline leaves are linear\r\nor linear-lanceolate, slightly recurved, glabrous, smooth along the\r\nmargins, and slightly fleshy. There is a single central vein along the\r\nlength of each leaf. The leaves are about 2-5\" long; their width varies\r\nsomewhat depending on the local ecotype, but it is usually about �\"\r\nacross. The stem terminates in a floppy raceme of flowers. Each flower\r\nis about 8 mm. (1/3\") across when it is fully open, consisting\r\nof 5 petals, 2 green sepals, 5 stamens with pink anthers, and a pistil\r\nwith a tripartite style. The petals are white with fine pink stripes;\r\nthese stripes vary from pale pink to bright pink. The flowers open up\r\non warm sunny days, and close during cloudy weather or at night. They\r\nare more or less erect while open, but nod downward while closed. The\r\nblooming period occurs from mid- to late spring and lasts about 1-2\r\nmonths. There is a pleasant floral scent. Each fertile flower\r\nproduces an ovoid capsule containing several seeds; this capsule is\r\nenclosed by the 2 persistant sepals. The root system consists of a\r\nsmall corm and secondary roots. This wildflower spreads by reseeding\r\nitself; sometimes it forms rather loose colonies of plants.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Close-up of Flowers\" src=\"../photos/spr_beauty1.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p><b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Cultivation:</font></b>\r\nThe preference is dappled sunlight during the spring, moist to slightly\r\ndry conditions, and a rich loamy soil with abundant organic matter.\r\nThis wildflower will adapt to semi-shaded areas of lawns if mowing is\r\ndelayed during the spring. Both the flowers and foliage fade away by\r\nmid-summer. The easy way to start plants is by obtaining\r\ntheir corms, although these are expensive to buy from\r\nnurseries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Range &amp; Habitat:</font></b>\r\nThe native Spring Beauty is a common wildflower that occurs in every\r\ncounty of Illinois (see <a href=\"../maps/map2.htm\" target=\"map\" onclick=\"window.open('','map','resizable=no,scrollbars=no,height=463,width=275,left=100,screenX=100,top=50,screenY=50')\">Distribution\r\nMap</a>). Habitats include moist to dry deciduous woodlands,\r\nsavannas, thinly wooded bluffs, city parks, old cemeteries, and lawns\r\n(particularly near trees). Less often, this species is found in mesic\r\nprairies, but it is primarily a woodland plant. Spring Beauty can\r\nsurvive more environmental degradation than most spring-blooming\r\nwoodland species, including occasional grazing by cattle and partial\r\nclearing of trees. This is one reason why it is still common.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 500px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Close-up of Leaves\" src=\"../photos/spr_beauty2.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p><b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Faunal\r\nAssociation:</font></b>\r\nAside from insect pollination, little is known about floral-faunal\r\nrelationships. Various kinds of bees visit the flowers, include honey\r\nbees, bumblebees, little carpenter bees (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ceratina spp.</span>),\r\nmason bees (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Osmia spp.</span>),\r\ncuckoo bees (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nomada spp.</span>),\r\nHalictid bees (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Agapostemon\r\nspp.</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Augochlorella\r\nspp.</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Halictus\r\nspp.</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Lasioglossum\r\nspp.</span>), and Andrenid bees (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Andrena spp.</span>). An\r\nAndrenid bee, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Andrena\r\nerigeniae</span>, is a specialist pollinator of Spring Beauty.\r\nMany flies also visit the flowers, including Syrphid flies, the Giant\r\nBee fly (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Bombylius major</span>),\r\nflesh flies (Sarcophagidae), and Calliphorid flies. Less often, various\r\nbutterflies and skippers visit the flowers. These insects usually seek\r\nnectar, although some of the bees also collect pollen. The corms of\r\nSpring Beauty are dug up and eaten by some small rodents, including the\r\nWhite-Footed Mouse and Eastern Chipmunk (Martin et al., 1951/1961;\r\nWrazen &amp; Svendsen, 1978). The foliage is browsed sparingly by\r\nWhite-Tailed Deer (Augustine, 1997). While the corms of Spring Beauty\r\ncan be eaten by humans as well, their small size makes this\r\nrather impractical.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 560px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Flowering Plants\" src=\"../photos/spr_beauty3.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p><b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Photographic\r\nLocation:</font></b>\r\nBusey Woods and an old cemetery in Urbana, Illinois.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Comments:</font></b>\r\nThis attractive wildflower is a sure sign that spring has arrived and\r\nthat the local woodlands are full of wildflowers. When Spring Beauty\r\nand these other wildflowers are conspicuously absent from a woodlands,\r\nthis indicates that it has been subjected to severe degradation from\r\nplows or bulldozers at some point in the past. In Illinois, Spring\r\nBeauty is a unique member of the Purslane family that is easy to\r\ndistinguish from other wildflowers. Look for pink-stripes, whether pale\r\nor bright, on the petals of the flowers, and only 2 sepals underneath.\r\nIn southeastern and other parts of the United States, there is a\r\nclosely related wildflower, <i>Claytonia carolina</i>\r\n(Carolina Beauty). This latter species has a similar appearance to\r\nSpring Beauty, but it doesn't occur in Illinois. The leaves of Carolina\r\nBeauty are usually broader than those of Spring Beauty.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"../woodland_index.htm#spr_beauty\">Return</a></p>\r\n<br>\r\n</font>\r\n</body></html>"}
