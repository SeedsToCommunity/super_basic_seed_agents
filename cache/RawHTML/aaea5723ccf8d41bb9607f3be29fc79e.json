The blades of the basal\r\nleaves are up to 8\" long and 6\" across; they are cordate to\r\noval-cordate in shape and crenate-serrate along their margins. The\r\nupper surface of these blades is medium green and hairless to\r\nshort-hairy, while the lower surface is pale green and hairy along the\r\nmajor veins. The petioles of the basal leaves are up to 6\" long, light\r\ngreen, and usually hairy. During the summer, unbranched or sparingly\r\nbranched stems with alternate leaves are produced, while the basal\r\nleaves wither away. These stems are light green to pale reddish green,\r\nterete, and variably hairy: usually the lower stems are hairless, while\r\nthe upper stems are short-hairy. The blades of alternate leaves are up\r\nto 4\" long and 3\" across; they are mostly cordate with margins that are\r\nserrate or crenate-serrate. Some of the upper leaf blades may be ovate\r\nin shape. The upper surface of these blades is medium green and\r\nhairless to short-hairy, while the lower surface is pale green and\r\nhairy along the major veins. The petioles of the alternate leaves are\r\nup to 3\" long and they are often winged, particularly where the\r\npetioles join the stem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 410px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"One Panicle of Lavender Flowerheads\" src=\"../photos/bglv_aster1.jpg\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\nThe upper central stem of each plant (and any\r\nupper lateral stems) terminates in a flat-headed panicle (corymb) of\r\nflowerheads spanning 3-8\" across. Individual flowerheads are �-1�\"\r\nacross, consisting of 8-20 ray florets that surround numerous disk\r\nflorets. The petal-like corollas of the ray florets are lavender or\r\nwhite. The tubular corollas of the&nbsp;disk florets are initially\r\npale\r\nyellow or yellow, but they later become orange-red, dark red, or brown.\r\nThe tubular corolla of each disk floret has 5 slightly spreading lobes\r\nat its apex. At the base of each flowerhead, there are numerous floral\r\nbracts (phyllaries) that are arranged in 4-6 series; they are appressed\r\nand overlapping. Individual floral bracts are more or less oblong\r\nin shape and mostly green, except for the narrow white margins along\r\ntheir sides; they are short-pubescent and occasionally ciliate along\r\ntheir margins. The tips of these bracts are usually blunt; less often,\r\nthey are somewhat pointed. The peduncles and pedicels of the panicle\r\nare light green, relatively stout, and covered with short glandular\r\nhairs. At the base of each branch of the panicle, there is usually a\r\nsingle leafy bract up to 1�\" long\r\nthat is broadly oblong or broadly elliptic; these bracts\r\nare sessile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 480px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Basal Leaves\" src=\"../photos/bglv_aster2.jpg\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blooming period occurs from\r\nlate summer to early fall and lasts about 1-1� months. During the\r\nautumn, both ray and disk florets are replaced by small bullet-shaped\r\nachenes; each achene has a tuft of tawny hairs at its apex. The achenes\r\nare distributed by the wind. The root system is fibrous and\r\nlong-rhizomatous; on older plants, a small caudex sometimes develops.\r\nThis wildflower often forms clonal colonies by means of the spreading\r\nrhizomes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 204, 51);\">Cultivation:</span>\r\nThe preference is partial sun to medium\r\nshade, moist to dry-mesic conditions, and soil consisting of rich\r\nloam or sandy loam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font><font face=\"Tahoma\"><img style=\"width: 275px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: right;\" title=\"Distribution Map\" src=\"../maps/mp_bglv_aster.GIF\" hspace=\"10\" vspace=\"10\"></font></font><span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 204, 51);\">Range\r\n&amp; Habitat:</span> The native Big-Leaved\r\nAster is found only in the northeast section of Illinois, where it is\r\nrare. This species is more common in areas that lie\r\nto the north or east of the state. Habitats consist of beech-maple\r\nwoodlands, sandy oak woodlands, sandy oak savannas, elevated areas\r\n(hummocks) in swamps, stabilized sand dunes where oak trees are\r\ndominant, and woodland borders. Usually, Big-Leaved Aster occupies\r\nhigh-quality natural areas that are more or less mesic (neither too dry\r\nnor too wet) and relatively little-disturbed by human activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 204, 51);\">Faunal\r\nAssociations:</span> The nectar and pollen of the flowers attract\r\na large\r\nvariety of insects, including long-tongued bees, short-tongued bees,\r\nwasps, flies, butterflies, beetles, and plant bugs. An oligolectic\r\nAndrenid bee, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Andrena\r\nhirticincta</span>, has been observed visiting the\r\nflowerheads of Big-Leaved Aster (see Graenicher). Other insects feed on\r\nthe foliage and flowers, suck plant juices, or bore through the\r\nstems and roots of this aster and others. Examples of such insect\r\nfeeders include caterpillars of the butterflies <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Chlosyne nycteis</span>\r\n(Silvery Checkerspot) and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Phyciodes\r\ntharos</span> (Pearl Crescent); also the caterpillars of\r\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Carmenta\r\ncorni</span> (Aster Borer Moth),\r\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Cucullia asteroides</span>\r\n(The Asteroid), <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Schinia\r\narcigera</span> (Arcigera Flower\r\nMoth), and other moths feed on asters (see <a name=\"moths\"></a><a href=\"../tables/table9.html\">Moth Table</a>). Other\r\ninsects\r\nfeeders include the larvae of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Calycomyza\r\nhumeralis</span> (Aster Leafminer\r\nFly), several aphids (mostly <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Uroleucon\r\nspp.</span>), <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Macrosteles\r\nquadrilineatus</span> (Aster Leafhopper), the lace bugs <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Corythucha marmorata</span>\r\nand <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Galeata spinifrons</span>,\r\nthe leaf beetles <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Exema\r\ncanadensis</span> and<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\r\nOphraella\r\npilosa</span>, the plant bug <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Plagiognathus\r\ncuneatus</span>, and others (see <a name=\"insects\"></a><a href=\"../tables/table10.html\">Insect\r\nTable</a> for a more complete listing of species). Some\r\nvertebrate animals\r\nuse asters as a food source. The Ruffed Grouse and Wild Turkey eat the\r\nseeds and foliage, while the White-Tailed Deer and Cottontail Rabbit\r\nsometimes browse on the foliage. The foliage is also\r\nedible to cattle, sheep, and other domesticated farm animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 204, 51);\">Photographic\r\nLocation:</span> The\r\nphotograph of the basal leaves was taken at a deciduous woodland in NW\r\nOhio, while the photographs of the flowerheads were taken at a woodland\r\nborder and a sandy oak savanna in the Indiana Dunes State\r\nPark, NW Indiana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 360px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Two Panicles of White Flowerheads\" src=\"../photos/bglv_aster3.jpg\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 204, 51);\"><br>\r\nComments:</span>\r\nSometimes Big-Leaved Aster is referred to as\r\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Aster macrophyllus</span>.\r\nThe large basal leaves of this aster are very\r\nconspicuous during the spring. During the autumn, Big-Leaved Aster\r\nresembles many other woodland asters and it is more difficult to\r\nidentify. However, it can be distinguished from similar species by the\r\nappearance of its floral bracts (phyllaries), the presence of\r\nshort glandular hairs on its peduncles and pedicels (a 10x hand lens\r\nmay be required), and the flat-headed characteristic of its panicles.\r\nMost asters have elongated panicles of flowerheads that are not\r\nflat-headed. A species that is not found in Illinois, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Eurybia\r\ndivaricata</span> (White Wood Aster), shares this flat-headed\r\ncharacteristic\r\nwith Big-Leaved Aster and its leaves have a similar shape.\r\nHowever, White Wood Aster has flowerheads with fewer ray florets (about\r\n5-10), its peduncles and pedicels usually have non-glandular hairs,\r\nand its basal leaves are smaller in size.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"../woodland_index.htm#bglv_aster\">Return</a><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</font>\r\n</body></html>"}
