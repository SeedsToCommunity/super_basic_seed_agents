The basal leaves are\r\ntrifoliate. The leaflets are up to 2�\" long and 1�\" across; they are\r\nobovate or oval in shape and coarsely toothed along their middle to\r\nouter margins. The tips of leaflets are rounded, while their bottoms\r\nare either wedge-shaped or rounded. The\r\nupper leaflet surface is medium to dark green and glabrous. The lower\r\nleaflet surface is variably hairy; fine hairs are most likely to occur\r\nalong the bases of central veins, but they may occur elsewhere along\r\nthe lower surface. Leaflet venation is pinnate and conspicuous. The\r\npetiolules (basal stalklets) of leaflets are light green, hairy,\r\nand very short (about 1 mm. in length). The petioles of basal leaves\r\nare up to 6\" long; they are light green to light reddish green, terete,\r\nand hairy. One or more umbel-like clusters of flowers are produced from\r\nlong peduncles up to 5\" long. These peduncles are light green to light\r\nreddish green, terete, and hairy. Each umbel-like cluster has about 4-6\r\nflowers on pedicels up to �\" long. These pedicels are light green to\r\nlight reddish green, terete, and hairy. At the base of these pedicels,\r\nthere are several bracts up to �\" long that are light green to dark\r\nred, lanceolate in shape, and hairy. </p>\r\n\r\n  <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 610px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Flower, Buds, &amp; Basal Leaves\" src=\"../photox/wld_strawberry1.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Individual\r\nflowers are about �&#8211;�\"\r\nacross when they are fully open; they can be pistillate, staminate, or\r\nperfect (staminate flowers are the least common). Each flower has 5\r\nwhite petals, 5 green sepals, and 5 green sepal-like bracts. The petals\r\nare oval to orbicular in shape; they are longer than either the sepals\r\nor sepal-like bracts. The sepals are lanceolate in shape and hairy,\r\nwhile the sepal-like bracts are linear-lanceolate and hairy; both\r\nsepals and sepal-like bracts are joined together at the base of the\r\nflower. Each pistillate flower has a dome-shaped cluster of pistils at\r\nits center that is greenish yellow or pale yellow. Each staminate\r\nflower has 20-35\r\nstamens with pale yellow filaments and yellow anthers.\r\nEach perfect flower has a dome-shaped cluster of pistils at its center\r\nand a ring of surrounding stamens. The blooming period occurs from late\r\nspring to early summer, lasting about 3-4 weeks. Afterwards, the\r\nflowers are replaced by fruits when growing conditions are favorable,\r\notherwise they abort. These fruits are up to �\" long and across; they\r\nare globoid or globoid-ovoid in shape, becoming bright red at\r\nmaturity. Small\r\nseeds are scattered across the surface of these fruits in sunken pits;\r\nthe persistent sepals and sepal-like bracts are appressed to the\r\nupper surface of these fruits. The fleshy interior of these fruits has\r\na\r\nsweet-tart flavor; they are edible. The root system consists of a\r\nshallow crown with fibrous roots. After the production of flowers and\r\nfruits, hairy above-ground stolons up to 2' long may develop from the\r\ncrown. When the tips of these stolons touch the ground, they often\r\nform plantlets that take root. In this manner, clonal colonies of\r\nplants often develop.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 540px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Close-up of Staminate Flower\" src=\"../photox/wld_strawberry2.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n  <p><b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Cultivation:</font></b>\r\nThe preference is full or partial sun, moist to dry-mesic\r\nconditions, and fertile soil containing loam or clay-loam. Wild\r\nStrawberry is a cool-season plant that grows actively during the spring\r\nand fall, but it often becomes dormant after setting fruit during the\r\nhot summer months. This plant is easy to cultivate, and it will spread\r\nto form a loose ground cover in open areas. The foliage is more\r\nresistant to foliar disease than most cultivated strawberries. While\r\nflowers are produced reliably every spring where there is adequate\r\nsunlight, the fruits may or may not develop, depending on the weather\r\nand environmental conditions. Watering plants during dry spells in late\r\nspring and early summer probably encourages fruits to develop. These\r\nfruits are much smaller in size than those of cultivated strawberries.<br>\r\n\r\n  <br>\r\n\r\n  <b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Range &amp; Habitat:</font></b>\r\nThe native Wild Strawberry is common in most areas of\r\nIllinois, although in parts of NW and southern Illinois it is\r\noccasional or absent (see <a href=\"../mapx/mp_wld_strawberry.htm\" target=\"map\" onclick=\"window.open('','map','resizable=no,scrollbars=no,height=463,width=275,left=100,screenX=100,top=50,screenY=50')\">Distribution\r\nMap</a>).\r\nHabitats include black soil prairies, hill prairies, bluegrass\r\nmeadows, small meadows in wooded areas, open woodlands, woodland\r\nborders, savannas, limestone glades, roadsides, and areas along\r\nrailroads. Wild Strawberry is able to tolerate competition from taller\r\nplants because it develops early in the spring, and it is able to\r\ntolerate some shade later in the year. This plant occurs in both\r\ndegraded and high quality habitats, often not far from wooded areas.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 545px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Close-up of Mature Fruits\" src=\"../photox/wld_strawberry3.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n  <p><b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Faunal\r\nAssociations:</font></b>\r\nThe ecological value of Wild Strawberry to various insects, birds, and\r\nanimals is high. The nectar and pollen of the flowers attract little\r\ncarpenter bees (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ceratina\r\nspp.</span>), cuckoo bees (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nomada\r\nspp.</span>), mason bees\r\n(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Osmia spp.</span>),\r\nHalictid bees (including green metallic bees), Halictid\r\ncuckoo bees (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sphecodes\r\nspp.</span>), Andrenid bees, Syrphid flies,\r\nthick-headed flies (Conopidae), Tachinid flies, bottle flies (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Lucilia\r\nspp.</span>), flesh flies (Sarcophagidae), small butterflies, and\r\nskippers\r\n(see Robertson, 1929, &amp; others). These floral visitors are\r\nbeneficial because they cross-pollinate the flowers. Other insects feed\r\ndestructively on the foliage and other parts of Wild Strawberry.\r\nCaterpillars of the Grizzled Skipper (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pyrgus centaurae wyandot</span>)\r\nfeed on\r\nthis plant. Other insect feeders include larvae of such moths as the\r\nStrawberry Crown Borer (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Synanthedon\r\nbibionipennis</span>), Strawberry\r\nLeafroller Moth (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ancylis\r\ncomptana fragariae</span>), and Wild Strawberry Seed\r\nBorer (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Grapholita\r\nangleseana</span>).

Various vertebrate\r\nanimals eat the fruits and foliage of Wild Strawberry. Some upland\r\ngamebirds and songbirds eat the fruits, including the Ring-necked\r\nPheasant, Brown Thrasher, Eastern Towhee, Veery, and\r\nAmerican Robin. Some mammals, including the American Black Bear,\r\nOpossum, Franklin Ground Squirrel, Eastern Chipmunk, and White-footed\r\nMouse, also eat the fruits, as do the Eastern Box Turtle, Ornate Box\r\nTurtle, and Wood Turtle. By eating the fruits, these animals spread the\r\nseeds to new locations. The foliage of Wild Strawberry is a source of\r\nfood for the Ruffed Grouse and Cottontail Rabbit; it is also browsed by\r\nhorses, cattle, sheep, and\r\ngoats.

The cultivated strawberry inherited the superior flavor\r\nof the Wild Strawberry (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fragaria\r\nvirginiana</span>)\r\nand the larger fruit size of the Coastal Strawberry. The Wild\r\nStrawberry produces attractive white flowers during the spring and\r\nsmall red fruits during the early summer. It is similar in appearance\r\nto another native species, the Hillside Strawberry (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fragaria vesca americana</span>).\r\nThe fruits of Hillside Strawberry have sepals and sepal-like bracts\r\nthat are spreading to reflexed, rather than appressed. The fruits of\r\nHillside Strawberry also have seeds scattered on top of their surfaces,\r\nrather than enclosed in shallow pits. This strawberry species is found\r\nin northern Illinois, where it is uncommon. It is closely related to\r\nthe Alpine Strawberry (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fragaria\r\nvesca vesca</span>), which is found in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p align=\"center\"><a href=\"../plant_index.htm#wild_strawberry\">Return</a></p>\r\n\r\n  <br>\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n</font>\r\n</body></html>"}
