The central stem is glabrous and either terete or 4-angled.\r\nEach pair of opposite leaves rotates 90� from the position of the pair\r\nof leaves immediately below. For <i>var. linifolia</i> of\r\nWhite Turtlehead, these leaves are less than �\" across and they are\r\nlinear-lanceolate in shape. However, the typical variety of White\r\nTurtlehead has some leaves greater than �\" and they are lanceolate or\r\noblong-lanceolate in shape. The leaves are hairless and finely serrated\r\nalong\r\ntheir margins. At their bases, the leaves are sessile, or they have\r\npetioles that are\r\nless than �\" in length. The central stem terminates in a dense spike of\r\nwhite flowers about 3-6\" in length, blooming from the bottom to the\r\ntop. </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Floral Spike\" src=\"../photos/wh_turtlehead1.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p>Each flower is\r\nabout 1�\" long, consisting of a 2-lipped white corolla, a green calyx\r\nwith 5 oval teeth, a slender white style, and 5 hairy stamens. Four of\r\nthese stamens have fertile anthers, while the remaining stamen\r\nis sterile and green. The tubular corolla is somewhat flattened at the\r\nmouth, where it is more wide than tall. The upper lip of the corolla\r\nfunctions as a protective hood, while the lower lip has 2-3 shallow\r\nlobes and functions as a landing pad for visiting insects. The lower\r\ninterior of the corolla has abundant white hairs. At the base of the\r\ncalyx, there are a few green bracts that resemble the sepals. The\r\nblooming period occurs from late summer to fall and lasts about 1month.\r\nThere is no noticeable floral scent. Each flower is replaced by\r\nan ovoid seed capsule containing several seeds that are flattened and\r\nbroadly winged; these seeds can be blown about by the wind and probably\r\nfloat on water. The root system consists of a taproot and rhizomes.\r\nVegetative colonies may form as a result of these rhizomes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Cultivation:</font></b>\r\nThe preference is full or partial sun, wet to moist conditions, and a\r\nfertile soil containing some organic matter. Temporary flooding is\r\ntolerated. This plant can be maintained in gardens if it is watered\r\nduring dry spells.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 580px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Stem &amp; Leaves\" src=\"../photos/wh_turtlehead2.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p><b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Range &amp;\r\nHabitat:</font></b>\r\nThe native White Turtlehead occurs occasionally in central and northern\r\nIllinois,\r\nbut it is rare in the southern part of the state (see <a href=\"../maps/mp_wh_turtlehead.htm\" target=\"map\" onclick=\"window.open('','map','resizable=no,scrollbars=no,height=463,width=275,left=100,screenX=100,top=50,screenY=50')\">Distribution\r\nMap</a>). The typical variety of this species is more abundant\r\nthan <i>var. linifolia</i>. Habitats include open\r\nwoodlands in floodplain areas, thickets in floodplain areas, wet\r\nprairies, sedge meadows, seeps, springs, marshes, and fens. These\r\nhabitats can be either sandy or non-sandy. White\r\nTurtlehead is an indicator plant of fens, where the ground water ranges\r\nfrom slightly acid to alkaline, but it occurs in other high quality\r\nwetland habitats as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Faunal Associations:</font></b>\r\nThe flowers are pollinated by nectar-seeking bumblebees; sometimes they\r\nalso attract the Ruby-Throated Hummingbird. In the northern half of\r\nIllinois, White Turtlehead is the preferred host for caterpillars\r\nof the butterfly <i>Euphydryas phaeton phaeton</i>\r\n(Baltimore). This butterfly is fairly uncommon. Other insects that feed\r\non the foliage of White Turtle include leaf-mining larvae of\r\nthe flea beetle <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Diabolia\r\nchelones,</span> larvae of the sawfly <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tenthredo grandis</span>,\r\nand larvae of the sawfly <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Macrophya\r\nnigra</span>. The seeds are eaten by larvae of the fly<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Phytomyza chelonei</span>\r\nand larvae of the polyphagous moth <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Endothenia\r\nhebesana</span>, while larvae of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Papaipema nepheleptena</span>\r\n(Turtlehead Borer Moth) bore through the stems (Clark et al. 2004,\r\nSmith 2006, Eastman, 1995). The foliage is bitter and usually avoided\r\nby White-Tailed Deer and other mammalian herbivores.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 530px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Close-up of Flowers &amp; Buds\" src=\"../photos/wh_turtlehead3.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p><b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Photographic\r\nLocation:</font></b>\r\nA prairie swale at Meadowbrook Park in Urbana, Illinois. In\r\nsome photographs, the plants with yellow flowerheads in the background\r\nare <i>Bidens polylepis</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Comments:</font></b>\r\nThe interesting flowers of this species resemble the head of a turtle,\r\nhence the common name. Because of these unique flowers, <i>Chelone\r\nspp.</i> (turtleheads) are easy to distinguish from other groups\r\nof plants. Among the turtleheads occurring in the Midwest, White\r\nTurtlehead is unique in having white flowers (although they are\r\nsometimes tinted light pink or pale purple). It also has more narrow\r\nleaves than other turtleheads, which is especially pronounced in <i>var.\r\nlinifolia</i>, as illustrated in the photograph of the leaves.\r\nThe other turtlehead species that occurs in Illinois, <i>Chelone\r\nobliqua</i>\r\n(Pink Turtlehead), has pink flowers and broader leaves with longer\r\npetioles (these petioles exceed �\" in length). This species is uncommon\r\nand usually occurs in damp wooded habitats.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"../wetland_index.htm#wh_turtlehead\">Return</a></p>\r\n<br>\r\n</font>\r\n</body></html>"}
