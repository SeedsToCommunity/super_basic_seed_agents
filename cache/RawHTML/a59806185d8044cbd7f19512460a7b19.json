The culms are\r\nunbranched, light green, sharply 3-angled, and glabrous; they have\r\nalternate leaves. The leaf blades are 1-3 mm.\r\nacross; they are usually shorter than the fertile culms, but longer\r\nthan the sterile culms. The leaf blades are light green,\r\nglabrous, and furrowed along their midveins; they are\r\nascending to widely spreading and arching. The leaf sheaths are light\r\ngreen, longitudinally\r\nveined, and glabrous. Each fertile culm terminates in an inflorescence\r\nconsisting of a terminal staminate spikelet, 2-3 pistillate spikelets,\r\nand their bracts. The narrow staminate spikelet is 1.0&#8211;2.5 cm. long on\r\na short peduncle. The staminate scales of this spikelet are 3.5&#8211;5.0 mm.\r\nlong, 1.5 mm. across, and lanceolate or elliptic in shape; they are\r\ndark purple during the blooming period, often with green midveins and\r\nmembranous margins. The large anthers of the staminate florets are\r\ncream-colored and linear in shape; they become dull light brown with\r\nage. The sessile pistillate spikelets are much smaller in size than the\r\nstaminate spikelet; they are adjacent to each other or slightly\r\nseparated. Each pistillate spikelet has about 4-12 perigynia and their\r\nscales. </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 330px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Young Inflorescence\" src=\"../photos/pn_sedge1.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p>The perigynia are\r\n2.5&#8211;3.0 mm. long and 1.5 mm. across; they have ovoid-globoid bodies\r\nwith short\r\nstout beaks and stipe-like bases that are also short and stout.\r\nImmature perigynia are light green and either glabrous\r\nor finely short-pubescent. The pistillate scales are about the same\r\nlength as the perigynia; they are ovate in shape, dark purple, and\r\nmembranous along their margins. Each pistillate floret has 3 styles\r\nthat are slender and white. At the base of the lowest pistillate\r\nspikelet, there is a green to purple leafy bract that is as long or a\r\nlittle longer than the spikelet (up to 1 cm. in length). Other bracts\r\nof the inflorescence are smaller in size and often scale-like. The\r\nblooming period occurs from mid- to late spring, lasting about 1-2\r\nweeks. The florets are cross-pollinated by the wind. The achenes are\r\nabout 1.5&#8211;2.0 mm. long, globoid-obovoid in shape, and slightly\r\n3-angled. The root system produces long stolons than run along the\r\nsurface of the soil (underneath fallen leaves and other debris). Loose\r\nclonal colonies are often formed from these stolons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Cultivation:</font></b>\r\nPennsylvania Sedge prefers partial or dappled sunlight and mesic to dry\r\nconditions with good drainage. A sandy loam or loose loam with abundant\r\norganic matter is preferred; this sedge also adapts to thin rocky soil\r\nif there is a layer of loam and decaying organic matter on top.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 410px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Tufts of Leaves\" src=\"../photos/pn_sedge2.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p><b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Range &amp;\r\nHabitat:</font></b>\r\nThe native Pennsylvania Sedge is occasional to locally common in most\r\nareas of Illinois; it is least common in south-central Illinois (see <a href=\"../maps/mp_pn_sedge.htm\" target=\"map\" onclick=\"window.open('','map','resizable=no,scrollbars=no,height=463,width=275,left=100,screenX=100,top=50,screenY=50')\">Distribution\r\nMap</a>). Habitats include upland woodlands, thinly\r\nwooded bluffs, wooded slopes, sandy savannas, rocky or sandy\r\nopenings in wooded areas, hill prairies, and upland prairies. This\r\nsedge is often found in dry woodland areas where oak trees (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Quercus spp.</span>)\r\nare present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Faunal Associations:</font></b>\r\nInsects that are known to feed on Pennsylvania Sedge include the\r\nleafhopper <i>Cosmotettix delector</i>, the aphid <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Iziphya albipes</span>,\r\nand such grasshoppers as <i>Arphia pseudonietana</i>\r\n(Red-winged Grasshopper), <i>Orphuella speciosa</i>\r\n(Pasture Grasshopper), and <i>Trachyrhachys kiowa</i>\r\n(Kiowa Grasshopper). Other insects that feed on sedges (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Carex spp.</span>) include\r\nlarvae of the grass-miner moths <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Elachista\r\nargentosa</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Elachista\r\nmadarella</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Chloealtis\r\nabdominalis</span> (Thomas' Broad-winged Grasshopper), and such\r\naphids as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Iziphya\r\nflabella</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Carolinaia\r\ncaricis</span>, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Vesiculaphis\r\ncaricis</span>\r\n(Panzer et al., 2006; Wyoming Agr. Exp. Sta., 1994; Vickery &amp;\r\nKevan, 1985; Microleps website, 2010; Blackman &amp;\r\nEastop, 2013). Various birds eat the seeds of sedges in habitats\r\nthat are favored by Pennsylvania Sedge; these species include the\r\nGreater Prairie Chicken, Wild Turkey, immature Ruffed Grouse, Eastern\r\nTowhee, and various sparrows (Martin et al., 1951/1961). Sedges in\r\nsuch habitats are a source of food to the Prairie Vole as well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 330px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Older Inflorescence\" src=\"../photos/pn_sedge3.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p><b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Photographic\r\nLocation:</font></b>\r\nWooded slopes in Vermilion County, Illinois.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font color=\"#33cc33\">Comments:</font></b>\r\nThis is one of the first sedges to bloom during the spring.\r\nPennsylvania Sedge (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Carex\r\npensylvanica</span>) is very similar to <i>Carex lucorum</i>\r\nand Sun Sedge (<i>Carex heliophila</i>); these latter two\r\nspecies are sometimes considered different varieties of Pennsylvania\r\nSedge (e.g., <i>Carex pensylvanica distans</i> and <i>Carex\r\npensylvanica digyna</i> respectively). Compared to Pennsylvania\r\nSedge, these species/varieties have longer perigynia (3.0&#8211;4.0 mm. in\r\nlength). The perigyneal beaks of <i>Carex lucorum</i> are\r\nmore slender and long than those of Pennsylvania Sedge, while Sun\r\nSedge has leaf blades that are more stiff and revolute (rolled). Two\r\nother species that are similar in appearance, <i>Carex\r\ncommunis</i> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Carex\r\nalbicans</span>, lack the\r\nlong stolons of Pennsylvania Sedge. Most of these species prefer\r\nsimilar habitats to Pennsylvania Sedge, although Sun Sedge is more\r\ncommon in the open prairies of the Great Plains states.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"../grass_index.htm#pa_sedge\">Return</a></p>\r\n<br>\r\n</font>\r\n</body></html>"}
