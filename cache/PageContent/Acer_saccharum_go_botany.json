Trees planted by colonial settlers survive to this day, often with large, gnarly trunks and deeply fissured bark. The silhouette of the sugar maple leaf is the centerpiece of the Canadian flag. The golden-brown wood has an attractive and easy-to-work grain, sometimes enhanced by a fungus that gives it a wavy, almost iridescent texture called \"bird's-eye.\" Maple syrup yields over $100 million and 4000 seasonal jobs in Vermont alone each year, but the industry may decline as spring climates change and sugar maples become less common at southern New England latitudes.\n                \n            \n        \n\n        \n            Habitat\n            \n              \n              \n                Floodplain (river or stream floodplains), forests, talus and rocky slopes\n              \n              \n            \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n                New England distribution\n                Adapted from BONAP\n                data\n\n\n                \n                \n\n                \n                    Native: indigenous.\n                    Non-native: introduced\n                    (intentionally or\n                    unintentionally); has become naturalized.\n                    County documented: documented\n                    to exist in the county by\n                    evidence (herbarium specimen, photograph).
