See the glossary for icon descriptions.\nDetailed Information\n\n\nFlower:  \n\n Two to 10+ stalked flowers in a raceme at the top of the stem that elongates by several inches as the plant matures. Each flower is up to ½ inch (5 to 12 mm) across with 5 pale pink to white petals with darker pink veins and a spot of yellow at the base, and 5 pink-tipped stamens.\n\n\n Cupping the flower is a pair of green to purple-tinged, egg-shaped sepals shorter than the petals. The flowers close up at night and on cloudy days. Closed flowers and buds nod down and become erect when the flower opens.\n\nLeaves and stem:  \n\n A single pair of oppositely attached leaves is about midway up the stem; a few similar basal leaves are usually also present. Leaves are 2½ to 6 inches (6 to 15 cm) long, ¼ to ½ inch (5 to 13 mm) wide, narrowly lance-elliptic to linear, toothless, hairless, tapering to a pointed tip and tapering at the base. Stem leaves are stalkless or nearly so, basal leaves may have a stalk longer or shorter than the blade. Stems are erect or prostrate from the base before rising (decumbent) and hairless. One or more stems may arise from globular tubers.\n\nFruit: \n Fruit is a round, 3-sectioned capsule containing several smooth, shiny seeds 2 to 3 mm long. The seeds have a coating that attracts ants, which disperse the seeds.\n\nNotes:Spring Beauties are a welcome sight after a long Minnesota winter and are one of our true woodland spring ephemerals, the flowers short-lived, quickly producing fruit, and the whole plant withering away into dormancy by the time trees are fully leafed out. Carolina Spring Beauty (Claytonia caroliniana) is very similar, but has shorter and wider leaves, and is only found in northeast Minnesota, mostly within a few miles of Lake Superior's north shore.Fun fact: we took an early spring trip south some years ago and discovered Virginia Spring Beauty as common a lawn weed in Arkansas as violets are here.\n\n\nMore photos\n\t\n Virginia Spring Beauty plant\n Virginia Spring Beauty plant\n Virginia Spring Beauty plants \n Virginia Spring Beauty in early evening\n more flowers\n typical Virginia Spring Beauty habitat\n it's a lawn weed in Arkansas!\n\n\nPhotos by K.
