The basal leaves are 2�-6\"\nlong and �-2\" across; they are ascending to erect, elliptic-lanceolate\nin shape, and smooth (entire) along their margins. The upper leaf\nsurface is mottled pale green and brown or greenish brown, while the\nlower surface is\nsolid medium green; both surfaces are glabrous and the lower surface is\noften glaucous. The petioles of these leaves are relatively long, but\nthey are located mostly or entirely underneath the ground surface.\nImmature shoots are\nsingle-leaved and they produce no flowers, while mature shoots have two\nleaves and they are single-flowered. Immature shoots are more common\nthan mature shoots. \n\n\nThe\ninflorescence has a long flowering stalk that\nis terete, glabrous, and light green to pale reddish brown. This stalk\nis mostly erect or ascending, but it nods downward at its tip where the\nflower occurs. The nodding flower is �-1�\" long, consisting of 6 yellow\ntepals, 6 stamens, and an ovary with 3 erect stigmata. Initially, the\ntepals are barely separated from each other, but as the flower matures\nthey become strongly recurved, exposing the reproductive organs. These\ntepals are narrowly elliptic-lanceolate in shape, and they are often\ntinted red or reddish brown along their outer sides. The\nstamens are about �\" long and their anthers are yellow or yellow-brown.\nThe blooming period occurs during mid-spring and lasts about 2 weeks.\nAfterwards, the flowers are replaced by obovoid seed capsules that are\nabout �\" in length or a little longer. These capsules are glabrous and\ntheir apices are truncate to rounded. At maturity, these capsules\ndivide into 3 parts to release their seeds. \n\n\nThe root system consists of\na corm with fibrous roots underneath, and 0-3 stolons. The stolons\nextend below the leaf litter, creating clonal offshoots from the mother\nplant. As a result, colonies of plants are often formed,\nconsisting largely of immature shoots.\n\nCultivation:\nThe\npreference is dappled sunlight to medium shade, more or less mesic\nconditions, and loamy soil with leaf litter and decaying organic\nmatter. Most growth and development occurs during the spring before the\ntrees fully develop their vernal leaves. This wildflower adapts readily\nto the shade of various deciduous trees. It takes several years of\ndevelopment (typically about 8 years) before individual plants will\nflower in a typical woodland setting.\n\n\nRange & Habitat: The\nnative Yellow Trout Lily is occasional in southern Illinois, while in\nthe rest of the state it is uncommon or absent (see Distribution\nMap).\nOutside of southern Illinois, it is largely restricted to the eastern\nhalf of the state. Illinois lies toward the western range limit of this\nplant; it is more common further to the east. Habitats include rich\nwoodlands, wooded bluffs, rocky woodlands, and banks of streams. Yellow\nTrout Lily is found in deciduous woodlands, where Sugar Maple (Acer\nsaccharum), American Beech (Fagus grandifolia),\nand other deciduous\ntrees are present.\n\n\nFaunal Associations: The nectar and pollen of\nthe flowers attract largely bees, including bumblebees, Mason bees, and\nAndrenid bees. One bee species, Andrena\nerythronii, is a weak oligolege\n(specialist pollinator) of Erythronium\nspp. (Trout Lilies). Like\nseveral other woodland wildflowers, the seeds of Yellow Trout Lily are\ndistributed in part by ants, which are attracted to their food\nappendages. Because the leaves of this plant are relatively small and\ninconspicuous, they are browsed by White-tailed Deer to only a limited\nextent. The mottled pattern of the leaves helps to disguise them from\nsuch mammalian herbivores as they lack color vision.\n\nPhotographic\nLocation: A deciduous woodland at Jim Smith's farm in\nVermilion County, Illinois.\n\n\nComments:\nThis is the\nonly yellow-flowered Trout Lily (Erythronium)\nin Illinois, making it\neasy to identify. The other two species of Trout Lily within the state,\nErythronium albidum (White\nTrout Lily) and Erythronium\nmesochoreum\n(Prairie Trout Lily), have either white flowers or bluish\nwhite\nflowers. Both the flowers and foliage of Yellow Trout Lily are quite\nattractive, although the blooming period is rather short and most\nplants fail to flower during any given year. In Illinois, Yellow Trout\nLily is much less common than White Trout Lily. However, in states\nfurther to the east, the reverse is true: Yellow Trout Lily is more\ncommon than White Trout Lily.\n"
