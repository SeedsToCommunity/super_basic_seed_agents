It is best introduced into a situation using plants; it spreads by runners readily. Wild Strawberries grows in a wide variety of sun and soil conditions: full sun to nearly full shade, prairie, meadows, fields, on moist ground, along the edge of woods, and on hillsides. The fruit ripens in late spring or early summer. They are much smaller than commercial strawberries but probably the most delicious of the wild fruits.Virginia Strawberry is another common name for this species.*This species may be difficult and/or slow to germinate and grow to maturity. Please note the germination code. Seed of this species is kept under refrigeration (33-38 F) in our warehouse. The days in transit to you in colder or warmer conditions won’t harm the seed, but it should be put back in refrigeration until you are ready to plant or apply pre-sowing treatment.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLive Plant Shipping Table\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSpring\n\t\t\tFall\n\t\t\tAge/Size\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDormant Bare Roots\n\t\t\tApril-May\n\t\t\tOctober\n\t\t\t1 year\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPotted 3-Packs\n\t\t\tApril-June\n\t\t\tAugust-September\n\t\t\t2.5\" wide x 3.5\" deep pots\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPotted Trays of 32\n\t\t\tApril-June\n\t\t\tAugust-September\n\t\t\t2.5\" wide x 3.5\" deep pots\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPotted Trays of 50\n\t\t\tApril-June\n\t\t\tAugust-September\n\t\t\t2\" wide x 5\" deep plugs\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Key\n\n\n\nPresent in state\n\n\n\n\nPresent but introduced in county\n\n\n\n\nPresent and native in county; not rare\n\n\n\n\nNot present in state\n\n\n\n\nPresent and native in county; rare\n\n\n\n\nSpecies extirpated (historic)\n\n\n\n\nState or county listed as noxious\n\n\n\n\nPresent in state; exotic\n\n\nThis map shows the native and introduced (adventive) range of this species.

We take great pride in keeping good genetic records on all of our plants. The genotype can change for any of our plants/seed from year to year, or we could have multiple lots from different areas of the Midwest, but we do always record that information.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nBeth\nAugust 19\n\nIs there any benefit in growing wild strawberry? Other than the fruit, obviously. Is it a big hit with wildlife? If so, should I just plant it in my lawn or in a bed?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nAugust 23\n\nWe have published a PLANT/INSECT INTERACTIONS chart with Heather Holm's help. Wild Strawberry attracts 7 of the 9 categories of pollinating insects/birds in this chart! \n\nI don't think it will do well long-term in a traditional lawn.  Although it spreads by runners and seeds, the thick mat that lawn grass is intended to form would choke out the strawberry plants eventually.  I think using it around garden edges (wet or dry! full sun or full shade!) would be effective.  Or, yes, in its own garden bed, would be ideal. It spreads so readily, you could dig new plants each year and establish them in different spots.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nJudith\nMay 11\n\nI started with a few plants from PMN several years ago and have enjoyed their blossoms and the pollinators they attract. But in all this time I have yet to see a strawberry! It's growing everywhere, sun, shade, moist soil, dry—as you say it does (exclamatorily). What's up with this plant? I live in rural western Maryland, Washington County, if that helps at all. I'd really love to enjoy the fruit of this otherwise fine ground cover. Thank you.\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nMay 12\n\nThanks for writing, Judith. I ask myself that question nearly every year. I have hundreds of Wild Strawberries covering a slope on a wood’s edge near my home and, unless I am extremely vigilant, checking daily, I miss the fruits or find only a couple. I blame the birds, chipmunks and other woodland critters who abound here. A few plants are flowering already in our chilly spring and I’m hoping that this year I can find fruits first. They are tiny but packed with tangy flavor. Good luck this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nIris\nApril 30\n\nCan this plant tolerate occasional foot traffic or is it too delicate? I'm not thinking of putting it in a pathway but it might get walked on sometimes.\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nMay 3\n\nHi Iris, \n\nYes, this species can tolerate light foot traffic. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nMandi\nJuly 31\n\nWill this grow in acid soil under walnut and beechnut trees? Will it do better in full or part shade?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nAugust 2\n\nHi Mandy,\nFragaria will grow well in mildly acidic soils, but it may struggle under walnuts. Though it is shade-tolerant, it will probably do better with more sun.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nLinda\nJanuary 13\n\nIf seeds are planted in early winter and naturally stratify, how much growth can you expect the first growing season?  Will they begin to spread, flower, and fruit in the first year?  Many native perennials do not bloom for 2 or 3 years, but this plant much smaller than most.\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nJanuary 14\n\nAfter speaking with our production manager, he said that it is common for these species to bloom after 2 years, sometimes (if lucky) they may bloom in the first year! Best of luck to you!\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nLaura\nApril 17\n\nCan these plants become invasive?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nApril 19\n\nHi Laura. No, despite Wild Strawberry putting out runners, they are easily  managed. They are shallow-rooted and can be dug out; they won't spread fast by seed like many known invasives.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nNick\nApril 3\n\nWhat plants do wild strawberries grow alongside in the wild? Would they establish well alongside side oats grama? Or is that grass too tall?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nApril 6\n\nHi Nick. True, Wild Strawberry is incredibly versatile so could grow with drier prairie grasses like Side-Oats, but yes, it may not thrive or be choked out since it likes to hug the ground.  Here in SE MN we see it most happy in part sun to full sun situations growing with shorter plants like native Violets, Virginia Waterleaf, Pennsylvania Sedge.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nJanet\nAugust 17\n\nI purchased a tray of Fragaria virginiana a couple of hears ago.  They are thriving but I am surprised by how large the leaves are.  They are even larger than the  strawberries I grow for fruit.  Is this normal?  Strawberries I see in the wild are much smaller.\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nAugust 22\n\nHello Janet,\n\nHere is a note from our head grower.\n\n\"We have noticed that they get really big in the Green House. All seed lots we have grown out get much bigger than they were originally. They seem to do this with any degree of cultivation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nDeb\nJanuary 3\n\nRegarding seed coverage, PMN stated that there are approximately 1,038 seeds per 1/8 ounce.  When I made my purchase, I assumed there were approximately 10,375 seeds per 1/8 ounce.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, but if I'm correct, can you please give a new estimate of coverage.  Thanks so much.\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nJanuary 6\n\nHello Deb, You are correct, In one eighth oz would have an estimated 10,375 seeds. If we average around 50 seeds per square foot you would end with an area to be seeded into of 207 square feet. I hope this helps!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeed\nGrowing your own plants from seed is the most economical way to add natives to your home. Before you get started, one of the most important things to know about the seeds of wild plants is that many have built-in dormancy mechanisms that prevent the seed from germinating. In nature, this prevents a population of plants from germinating all at once, before killing frosts, or in times of drought. To propagate native plants, a gardener must break this dormancy before seed will grow.\nEach species is different, so be sure to check the GERMINATION CODE listed on the website, in the catalog, or on your seed packet. Then, follow the GERMINATION INSTRUCTIONS prior to planting. Some species don't need any pre-treatment to germinate, but some species have dormancy mechanisms that must be broken before the seed will germinate. Some dormancy can be broken in a few minutes, but some species take months or even years.\nSeed dormancy can be broken artificially by prolonged refrigeration of damp seed in the process of cold/moist STRATIFICATION. A less complicated approach is to let nature handle the stratifying through a dormant seeding, sowing seeds on the surface of a weed-free site in late fall or winter. Tucked safely beneath the snow, seeds will be conditioned by weathering to make germination possible in subsequent growing seasons.\nTo learn more, please visit: How to Germinate Native Seeds\n\n\nDormant Bare Root Plants\nWe dig plants when they are dormant from our outdoor beds and ship them April-May and October. Some species go dormant in the summer and we can ship them July/August. We are among the few still employing this production method, which is labor intensive but plant-friendly. They arrive to you dormant, with little to no top-growth (bare-root), packed in peat moss. They should be planted as soon as possible. Unlike greenhouse-grown plants, bare-root plants can be planted during cold weather or anytime the soil is not frozen. A root photo is included with each species to illustrate the optimal depth and orientation. Planting instructions/care are also included with each order.\nDownload: Installing Your Bare-Root Plants\n\n\nPotted Plants\n3-packs and trays of 32, 38, or 50 plants leave our Midwest greenhouses based on species readiness (being well-rooted for transit) and order date; Spring shipping is typically early May through June, and Fall shipping is mid-August through September. Plants shipped in spring may be overwintered and still emerging from dormancy. Potted plants are typically 4-9 months old when they ship. Plant tray cells are approximately 2” wide x 5” deep in the trays of 38 and 50, and 2.5\" wide x 3.5\" deep in the 3-packs and trays of 32; ideal for deep-rooted natives. Full-color tags and planting & care instructions are included with each order.\nDownload: Planting and Care of Potted Plants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: we are a mail order nursery and have no retail facilities, but you may pick up your order if prior arrangements are made. Pick up orders are subject to **MN Sales Tax.\nUS Shipping & Handling Charges\nSEED $100.00 and under: $5.00 Retail online SEED orders over $100.00 ship free! Custom seed mixes or discounted seed sales over $100, add 5% of the total seed cost. (for orders over $1,000 a package signature may be required)\nBARE ROOT and POTTED PLANTS $50.00 and under: $9.00 over $50.00: 18% of the total plant cost. (For orders over $1,000 a package signature may be required.)\nTOOLS and BOOKS have the shipping fee included in the cost of the product (within the contiguous US).\n**We are required to collect state sales tax in certain states. Your state's eligibility and % will be calculated at checkout. MN State Sales Tax of 7.375% is applied for orders picked up at our MN location. Shipping & handling charges are also subject to the sales tax.\n\n\nShipping Season\nSEED, TOOLS and BOOKS are sent year-round. Most orders ship within 1-3 business days.\nBARE ROOT PLANTS are shipped during optimal transplanting time: Spring (April-May) and Fall (Oct). Some ephemeral species are also available for summer shipping. Since our plants are field-grown, Nature sets the schedule each year as to when our season will begin and end. We fill all orders, on a first-come, first-serve basis, to the best of our ability depending on weather conditions beyond our control.\nPOTTED PLANTS (Trays of 32/38/50 plugs and 3-packs) typically begin shipping early May and go into June; shipping time is heavily dependent on all the species in your order being well-rooted. If winter-spring greenhouse growing conditions are favorable and all species are well-rooted at once, then we ship by order date (first come, first serve). We are a Midwest greenhouse, and due to the challenges of getting all the species in the Mix & Match and Pre-Designed Garden Kits transit-ready at the same time, we typically can't ship before early May. Earlier shipment requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n*We are unable to ship PLANTS (bare root or potted) outside the contiguous US or to CALIFORNIA due to regulations.\n\n\nDelivery\nWe ship using USPS, UPS and Spee Dee. UPS and Spee Dee are often used for expediting plant orders; they will not deliver to Post Office Box numbers, so please also include your street address if ordering plants. We send tracking numbers to your email address so please include it when you order.\nFOR MORE DETAILED SHIPPING INFORMATION, INCLUDING CANADA SHIPPING RATES (SEED ONLY), PLEASE SEE 'SHIPPING' AT THE FOOTER OF THIS WEBSITE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\n\nSeeds/Packet\n60\n\n\nSeeds/Ounce\n83,000\n\n\n\nGermination Code\n\n\nC(60)\n\n\n\nLife Cycle\nPerennial\n\n\n\nSun Exposure\n\nFull, Partial, Shade\n\n\n\nSoil Moisture\n\nMedium-Wet, Medium, Medium-Dry, Dry\n\n\n\nHeight\n\n6 inches\n\n\n\nBloom Time\n\nApril, May, June\n\n\nBloom Color\nWhite\n\n\nAdvantages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSDA Zones\n\n3-8\n\n\n\nPlant Spacing\n\n3-10\"\n\n\nCatalog Code\nFRA02F\n\n\n\n"
