The basal leaves are erect,\nascending, or widely spreading; they are 3-6\" long, �–1\"\nacross, elliptic or elliptic-oblanceolate in shape, and entire\n(toothless) along their margins. The slender petioles of basal leaves\nare 1-4\" long. The upper and lower surfaces of basal leaves are\nlight-medium green and either glabrous (var. lanceolata) or\nirregularly\ncovered with white hairs (var.\nvillosa). Fertile shoots produce one or\nmore stems from the base of each plant; these stems are ascending to\nerect, although their bases may rest on the ground. The stems are\nlight-medium green, terete, and either glabrous (var. lanceolata) or\nirregularly covered with white hairs (var. villosa).\nPairs of sessile\nopposite leaves occur primarily along the lower one-half of each plant.\n  \n\n  \n\n  Individual\nopposite leaves are either unlobed, or they may have 1-4\nbasal/lateral lobes and a terminal lobe. Unlobed opposite leaves are\n1-4\" long, linear-elliptic to elliptic in shape, and entire along their\nmargins. Other opposite leaves have lobes that are �–3\" long,\nlinear-elliptic to elliptic in shape, and entire along their margins.\nSome opposite leaves may have 1-2 short basal lobes, while other\nopposite leaves may have 2 basal lobes and 2 lateral lobes that\nare longer. The upper and lower surfaces of opposite leaves are\nlight-medium green and either glabrous (var. lanceolata) or\nirregularly\ncovered with white hairs (var.\nvillosa). The stems terminate in\nsolitary flowerheads on long naked peduncles (flowering stalks) up to\n12\" long. Each flowerhead spans 2-3\" across, consisting of about 8\nsterile ray florets that surround a dense head of numerous fertile disk\nflorets. The petaloid rays of the flowerhead are yellow, oblanceolate\nto obovate in\nshape, and 4-lobed along their tips. In addition to the 4 primary\nlobes, some secondary lobes may be present, providing the tips of the\npetaloid rays with a ragged appearance. \n\n  \n\n  The corollas of the disk\nflorets are about 6 mm. (�\") in length, yellow, tubular in shape,\nand 4-5 lobed. At the base of each flowerhead, there is a single series\nof about 8 phyllaries (inner floral bracts). These phyllaries are about\n8-10 mm. long, yellowish green to yellowish brown, and deltate-oval in\nshape; they are appressed along the bases of the petals when the\nflowerhead is in bloom. Slightly below the base of the flowerhead,\nthere is a single series of 8 outer bracts that are similar to the\nphyllaries, except they are more green and lanceolate-ovate in shape.\nThe blooming period occurs from late spring to mid-summer, lasting\nabout 1 month for a colony of plants. Afterwards, the disk florets are\nreplaced by achenes that are about 3 mm. long, 3 mm. across\n(including the membranous wings), brown, and flattened (slightly convex\non one side and slightly concave on the other side). The tips of these\nachenes soon become truncate because their paired awns are\nearly-deciduous. The root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, often\nforming colonies of clonal plants.\n\n  \n\n  Cultivation:\nThe\npreference is full sun, mesic to dry conditions, and poor soil\ncontaining sandy or rocky material. This plant will adapt to soil\ncontaining fertile loam if it is well-drained and taller plants are\nkept away from it. This plant is easy to grow from\ntransplants. In open areas with exposed ground, it may spread\naggressively.\n\n  \n\n  Range & Habitat:\nThe native Sand Coreopsis occurs in NE Illinois, counties\nalong the Illinois\nRiver, SW Illinois, and scattered counties elsewhere within\nthe state (see Distribution\nMap).\nIn Illinois, it is an uncommon plant. Habitats include mesic to dry\nsand prairies, gravel prairies, hill prairies,\nlimestone glades, thinly wooded bluffs, areas along railroads, and\nroadsides. Some local populations, particularly in heavily populated NE\nIllinois, may be\nplants that have escaped cultivation. In addition, some populations\nwithin the state are the result\nof habitat restoration efforts.\n\n  \n\n  Faunal\nAssociations:\nThe nectar and pollen of the flowers attract many kinds of insect\nvisitors,\nincluding long-tongued bees, short-tongued bees, wasps, flies,\nbutterflies, skippers, day-flying moths, and beetles. A long-tongued\nbee, Melissodes coreopsis) is an oligolege\n(specialist pollinator) of Coreopsis spp. Some\ninsects feed destructively on the plant juices, flowerheads, and other\nparts of Sand Coreopsis and other\nCoreopsis spp.\nThese species include the Ragweed Leaf Beetle (Calligrapha bidenticola)\nand Coreopsis Leaf Beetle (Calligrapha\ncalifornica coreopsivora), the Red-spotted Aster Mirid (Polymerus basalis),\nan aphid (Uroleucon\nreynoldense), and the larvae of such moths as the\nDimorphic Gray (Tornos\nscolopacinarius), Wavy-lined Emerald (Synchlora aerata),\nand Common Tan Wave (Pleuroprucha\ninsulsaria); see Clark et al. (2004), Knight (1941),\nBlackman & Eastop (2013), Covell (1984/2005), and Wagner (2005)\nfor more information. The larvae of the latter two moths feed on the\nflowerheads. Mammalian herbivores occasionally browse on the foliage of\n  Coreopsis spp.,\nincluding rabbits, groundhogs, deer, horses, and\nlivestock. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  Photographic\nLocation:\nThe photographs were taken at a sand prairie of Kickapoo State Park in\nVermilion County, Illinois, and at a flower garden in Urbana, Illinois.\n\n  \n\n  Comments:\nAnother common name for this plant is Lance-leaved Coreopsis, even\nthough the leaves are usually more broad toward their tips than near\ntheir bases. Sand Coreopsis (Coreopsis\nlanceolata) can be distinguished from other Coreopsis spp.\nprimarily by the lack of lobes on its basal leaves and some of its\nopposite leaves. Different populations of Sand Coreopsis can vary\nsignificantly in the hairiness of the stems and leaves, ranging from\nglabrous (var. lanceolata)\nto conspicuously hairy (var.\nvillosa). It has been suggested that the hairy variety may\nbe the result of a naturally occurring hybrid of Coreopsis lanceolata\nwith Coreopsis pubescens,\nor that it should be considered a distinct species (see Flora of North America,\nVol. 21, at: www.efloras.org). Sand Coreopsis is often grown\nin flower gardens because of its showy flowerheads. As a result, many\ncultivars have been developed, including those that are double-flowered\nand bicolored.\n\n  Return\n\n  \n\n"
