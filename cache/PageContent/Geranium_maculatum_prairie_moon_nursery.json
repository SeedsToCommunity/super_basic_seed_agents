It has lovely dissected leaves, \nbeautiful pinkish-purple flowers, and it readily spreads, forming stunning patches that everything from bees to butterflies can't resist. Mostly found in woodlands in the wild, it does just as well in full sun!  Interestingly, Geranium maculatum has a unique way of spreading its seeds.  \nEach seed is packed into a pod and the pods are attached to a structure that resembles a crane's bill.  As the bill dries, it literally catapults the seeds away \nfrom the parent plant (see corresponding photo).  Each seed has a small tail-like structure attached to it that bends and moves in response to changes in humidity, \nwhich helps to drive the seed into the soil where it can safely germinate.  We highly recommend Wild Geranium! In a garden setting it \ncan be important to plant a few later season plants (maybe Asters or Gentians) with it because the leaves can show summer stress.*This species (in seed) may be difficult and/or slow to germinate and \ngrow to maturity.  Please note the germination code on the right.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLive Plant Shipping Table\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSpring\n\t\t\tSummer\n\t\t\tFall\n\t\t\tAge/Size\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDormant Bare Roots\n\t\t\tApril-MayAugust\n\t\t\tOctober\n\t\t\t2-3 years\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPotted 3-Packs\n\t\t\tApril-JuneN/A\n\t\t\tAugust-September\n\t\t\t2.5\" wide x 3.5\" deep pots\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPotted Trays of 50\n\t\t\tApril-JuneN/A\n\t\t\tAugust-September\n\t\t\t2\" wide x 5\" deep plugs\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Key\n\n\n\nPresent in state\n\n\n\n\nPresent but introduced in county\n\n\n\n\nPresent and native in county; not rare\n\n\n\n\nNot present in state\n\n\n\n\nPresent and native in county; rare\n\n\n\n\nSpecies extirpated (historic)\n\n\n\n\nState or county listed as noxious\n\n\n\n\nPresent in state; exotic\n\n\nThis map shows the native and introduced (adventive) range of this species.

Also, if the seed germinates closer to Sept or Oct, it may not put on enough growth or be strong enough to survive the hard frosts to come.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nLori\nJuly 28\n\nI've got Geranium maculatum planted in quite a few spots in my yard.  I got them from Prairie Moon probably about 8 years ago.  It looks great everywhere in the spring.  After the flowers are done, I cut them back.  Now (July), they look fine almost everywhere (they are a bit more sparse and have a some spots on them, but overall, still look decent).  But there is one spot where they are extremely leggy and sparse.  I'm trying to figure out why?  Do they likely need to be divided...not enough nutrients...nearing the end of their life?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nJuly 29\n\nHi Lori. I don’t think that they would be nearing the end of their life. They may be done for the season though. Perhaps these leggy and sparse plants are in an infertile or drier soil compared to the other plants? Could it be too hot and dry? You could move them, or add some organic material as a thick top dressing and see if that helps. Maybe try dividing one end and see how they react before digging the whole thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nLynn\nMay 12\n\nAre these deer resistant?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nMay 13\n\nHi Lynn. We chose to not mark Wild Geranium deer resistant because, at least here in SE MN, we have observed populations of geranium flowers get nibbled off.  The leaves don't seem to be of interest to the white-tail deer population, but in some years, they will eat the flowers.  Every regions' deer population will vary a bit.  I would give Geranium maculatum a try in your garden; they are one of the most versatile and hardy natives we sell. Good luck!\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nShelley\nAugust 5\n\nCan I plant bare root geranium in late spring/early fall, or would it be better to wait until spring?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nAugust 6\n\nHi Shelley,\nYou can transplant a geranium root any time after the plant has gone dormant-- late summer, fall, or early spring. \n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nDiana\nAugust 23\n\nHi there, I plan to seed this in the fall in a new flower bed that gets full sun. I'm in Zone 7a. I wonder when I am likely to see it flower for the first time. Many thanks\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nAugust 25\n\nHi Diana,\nIt is unlikely they will flower in their first growing season, but hopefully they will bloom for you within a few years.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nAmanda\nOctober 20\n\nWill bareroot geraniums planted in fall have some flowering the following spring/summer?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nOctober 21\n\nBare-roots are typically 2-3 years old when they ship to you. There is a good chance they will bloom the following spring, but, due to the possibility of transplant shock, we can never guarantee blooms in the first growing season. \n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nJonathan\nJune 10\n\nHow salt tolerant is this plant?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nJune 11\n\nHi Jonathan. Wild Geranium does not have a lot of information available regarding salt tolerance, but it's always surprising how resilient these native plants can be. If you are willing to take the risk and experiment, let us know how they do! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeed\nGrowing your own plants from seed is the most economical way to add natives to your home. Before you get started, one of the most important things to know about the seeds of wild plants is that many have built-in dormancy mechanisms that prevent the seed from germinating. In nature, this prevents a population of plants from germinating all at once, before killing frosts, or in times of drought. To propagate native plants, a gardener must break this dormancy before seed will grow.\nEach species is different, so be sure to check the GERMINATION CODE listed on the website, in the catalog, or on your seed packet. Then, follow the GERMINATION INSTRUCTIONS prior to planting. Some species don't need any pre-treatment to germinate, but some species have dormancy mechanisms that must be broken before the seed will germinate. Some dormancy can be broken in a few minutes, but some species take months or even years.\nSeed dormancy can be broken artificially by prolonged refrigeration of damp seed in the process of cold/moist STRATIFICATION. A less complicated approach is to let nature handle the stratifying through a dormant seeding, sowing seeds on the surface of a weed-free site in late fall or winter. Tucked safely beneath the snow, seeds will be conditioned by weathering to make germination possible in subsequent growing seasons.\nTo learn more, please visit: How to Germinate Native Seeds\n\n\nDormant Bare Root Plants\nWe dig plants when they are dormant from our outdoor beds and ship them April-May and October. Some species go dormant in the summer and we can ship them July/August. We are among the few still employing this production method, which is labor intensive but plant-friendly. They arrive to you dormant, with little to no top-growth (bare-root), packed in peat moss. They should be planted as soon as possible. Unlike greenhouse-grown plants, bare-root plants can be planted during cold weather or anytime the soil is not frozen. A root photo is included with each species to illustrate the optimal depth and orientation. Planting instructions/care are also included with each order.\nDownload: Installing Your Bare-Root Plants\n\n\nPotted Plants\n3-packs and trays of 32, 38, or 50 plants leave our Midwest greenhouses based on species readiness (being well-rooted for transit) and order date; Spring shipping is typically early May through June, and Fall shipping is mid-August through September. Plants shipped in spring may be overwintered and still emerging from dormancy. Potted plants are typically 4-9 months old when they ship. Plant tray cells are approximately 2” wide x 5” deep in the trays of 38 and 50, and 2.5\" wide x 3.5\" deep in the 3-packs and trays of 32; ideal for deep-rooted natives. Full-color tags and planting & care instructions are included with each order.\nDownload: Planting and Care of Potted Plants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: we are a mail order nursery and have no retail facilities, but you may pick up your order if prior arrangements are made. Pick up orders are subject to **MN Sales Tax.\nUS Shipping & Handling Charges\nSEED $100.00 and under: $5.00 Retail online SEED orders over $100.00 ship free! Custom seed mixes or discounted seed sales over $100, add 5% of the total seed cost. (for orders over $1,000 a package signature may be required)\nBARE ROOT and POTTED PLANTS $50.00 and under: $9.00 over $50.00: 18% of the total plant cost. (For orders over $1,000 a package signature may be required.)\nTOOLS and BOOKS have the shipping fee included in the cost of the product (within the contiguous US).\n**We are required to collect state sales tax in certain states. Your state's eligibility and % will be calculated at checkout. MN State Sales Tax of 7.375% is applied for orders picked up at our MN location. Shipping & handling charges are also subject to the sales tax.\n\n\nShipping Season\nSEED, TOOLS and BOOKS are sent year-round. Most orders ship within 1-3 business days.\nBARE ROOT PLANTS are shipped during optimal transplanting time: Spring (April-May) and Fall (Oct). Some ephemeral species are also available for summer shipping. Since our plants are field-grown, Nature sets the schedule each year as to when our season will begin and end. We fill all orders, on a first-come, first-serve basis, to the best of our ability depending on weather conditions beyond our control.\nPOTTED PLANTS (Trays of 32/38/50 plugs and 3-packs) typically begin shipping early May and go into June; shipping time is heavily dependent on all the species in your order being well-rooted. If winter-spring greenhouse growing conditions are favorable and all species are well-rooted at once, then we ship by order date (first come, first serve). We are a Midwest greenhouse, and due to the challenges of getting all the species in the Mix & Match and Pre-Designed Garden Kits transit-ready at the same time, we typically can't ship before early May. Earlier shipment requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n*We are unable to ship PLANTS (bare root or potted) outside the contiguous US or to CALIFORNIA due to regulations.\n\n\nDelivery\nWe ship using USPS, UPS and Spee Dee. UPS and Spee Dee are often used for expediting plant orders; they will not deliver to Post Office Box numbers, so please also include your street address if ordering plants. We send tracking numbers to your email address so please include it when you order.\nFOR MORE DETAILED SHIPPING INFORMATION, INCLUDING CANADA SHIPPING RATES (SEED ONLY), PLEASE SEE 'SHIPPING' AT THE FOOTER OF THIS WEBSITE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\n\nSeeds/Packet\n45\n\n\nSeeds/Ounce\n5,000\n\n\n\nGermination Code\n\n\nC(60)\nM\n\n\n\nLife Cycle\nPerennial\n\n\n\nSun Exposure\n\nFull, Partial, Shade\n\n\n\nSoil Moisture\n\nMedium, Medium-Dry\n\n\n\nHeight\n\n12 inches\n\n\n\nBloom Time\n\nApril, May, June, July\n\n\nBloom Color\nPurple\n\n\nAdvantages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSDA Zones\n\n3-8\n\n\n\nPlant Spacing\n\n10-12\"\n\n\nCatalog Code\nGER02F\n\n\n\n"
