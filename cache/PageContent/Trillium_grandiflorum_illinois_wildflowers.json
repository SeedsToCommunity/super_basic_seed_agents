    "textContent": "Description:\nThis\nherbaceous perennial wildflower is �–1�' tall and unbranched. It\nconsists\nof a central stem with 3 terminal leaves; a mature plant will produce a\nsingle stalked flower. The central stem is terete, glabrous, and pale\ngreen or pale reddish-green. The terminal leaves are arranged in a\nwhorl at the apex of this stem. Each leaf is up to 6\" long and 5\"\nacross; it is oval-ovate or oval in shape, medium green, and glabrous.\nEach leaf has smooth margins and parallel primary veins. The single flower\nspans about 3-4\" across on a stalk about 1-3\" long. This stalk is\nascending or erect; the flower is held above the leaves and usually\nleans to the side (but doesn't droop downward). Each flower consists of\n3 white petals, 3 green sepals, a central white ovary, 6 stamens, and 3\nstigmas. The petals are ovate-obovate, widely spreading, and usually\nlonger than the sepals; they often become light pink with age. The\nsepals are lanceolate and widely spreading. The dull yellow stigmas are\nslender and either straight or slightly recurved. The blooming period\noccurs from mid- to late spring and lasts about 3 weeks. Each flower is\nreplaced by a 6-angled seed capsule that becomes dark with age; it\neventually splits open to release the seeds. The root system consists\nof a vertical rootstock with fibrous roots; spreading rhizomes are also\nproduced. Occasionally, this\nwildflower forms loose colonies of\nvariable size.\n\nCultivation:\nDappled sunlight or light shade is preferred during the spring; later\nin the year, more shade is tolerated. The soil should be rich, loamy,\nrather loose, and evenly moist; a surface layer of leaves and other\ndecaying organic material is desirable. This wildflower develops very\nslowly from seed (several years to maturity). It is also possible to\npropagate this species from vegetative offsets of the rhizomes, but\nthis takes time to develop as well.\n\nRange & Habitat:\nThe native Large-Flowered Trillium is occasional in NE Illinois, while\nin other\nareas of the state it is uncommon or absent. Populations of this\nspecies are stagnant or declining in Illinois; it is somewhat more\ncommon further to the east and northeast of the state. Habitats include\nrich deciduous woodlands, swamps, and shaded riverbanks. Occasionally,\nLarge-Flowered Trillium is cultivated in shade gardens, but it is\nexpensive and difficult to obtain; wild-collected plants should be\navoided.\n\nFaunal Associations:\nAs showy as they are, the flowers are rarely visited by insects;\nGraenicher observed a single species, Ceratina dupla\n(Little Carpenter Bee), sucking nectar and collecting pollen from them.\nAnother small bee, Andrena geranii, was observed to\nseek shelter in a flower from the rain. The caterpillars of two moths, Euplexia\nbenesimilis (American Angle Shades) and Clepsis\nmelaleucana (Black-Patched Clepsis), occasionally feed on Trillium\nspp. (trilliums); the latter species is polyphagous. The\nseeds of this and other trilliums are distributed by ants because of\ntheir elaisomes (food appendages). White-Tailed Deer readily browse on\nthe foliage and flowers of trilliums, and they appear to be attracted\nto Large-Flowered Trillium in particular (possibly because they can\neasily see the flowers). Where this trillium is abundant, its large\nleaves can provide significant cover for small mammals.\n\nPhotographic Location:\nA deciduous woodland in Piatt County, Illinois.Comments:\nAmong the\nvarious species of trilliums, this one is probably the most attractive\nand charismatic. The flowers are very showy and the leaves have a nice\nglossy surface. The only other species that is similar, Trillium\nflexipes (White Trillium), has flowers that are a little\nsmaller and more nodding; usually its flowers hang a little above or a\nlittle below the leaves. Large-Flowered Trillium has slender stigmas\nthat are straight or slightly recurved, while White Trillium has stout\nstigmas that are strongly recurved. While there are other white-petaled\ntrilliums in Illinois, their flowers are much smaller in size (2\"\nacross or less)."
