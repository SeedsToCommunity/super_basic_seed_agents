Although it grows largest in and near swamps, it abounds in New England forests and is becoming more common as sugar maple begins to succumb to climatic change. It grows rapidly and stump-sprouts readily. Although the wood can be used for veneer and a variety of small products such as boxes and clothespins, it is weaker and harder to work than sugar maple. Red maple also yields a sugary syrup, but in smaller quantities than sugar maple. As an early-successional forest tree, however, it provides browse for moose and many other mammals.\n                \n            \n        \n\n        \n            Habitat\n            \n              \n              \n                Forest edges, forests, meadows and fields, shores of rivers or lakes, swamps, wetland margins (edges of wetlands), woodlands\n              \n              \n            \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n                New England distribution\n                Adapted from BONAP\n                data\n\n\n                \n                \n\n                \n                    Native: indigenous.\n                    Non-native: introduced\n                    (intentionally or\n                    unintentionally); has become naturalized.\n                    County documented: documented\n                    to exist in the county by\n                    evidence (herbarium specimen, photograph).
