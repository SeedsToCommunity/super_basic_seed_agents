Most of the leaves occur near the base of the plant, although a\nfew of them alternate along the lower 1/3 of the stem. They are up to\n9\" long and 2\" across, and narrowly lanceolate, oblanceolate, or ovate.\nThe margins are smooth, but often curl upward, while the upper and\nlower surfaces of the leaves are covered with fine white hairs. Leaf\nvenation is primarily parallel, although a few fine pinnate veins may\nbe present. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  A single\ndaisy-like composite flower develops at the top of the stem. It is\nabout 3\" across, consisting of a prominent reddish brown cone of disk\nflorets, which are surrounded by 12-20 light purple ray florets. The\nray florets are long, slender, and droop downward. There is no\nnoticeable floral scent. The blooming period occurs during early summer\nand lasts about 3 weeks, after which the ray florets shrivel away and\nthe central cone turns black. The achenes are without tufts of hair.\nThe root system consists of a stout taproot.\n\n  \n\n  Cultivation:\nThe preference is full sun and average to dry conditions. The soil can\ncontain loam, clay, or rocky material. There is a tendency for Pale\nPurple Coneflower to flop over when in bloom if it is pampered by too\nmuch water or lacks adequate support from adajacent vegetation. It\ndoesn't seem to be bothered much by disease, and withstands drought\nvery well. Development is slow unless ample sunlight is received. This\nplant can fail to survive the winter if the central taproot is not\ncovered with sufficient soil.\n\n  \n\n  Range & Habitat:\nPale Purple Coneflower occurs occasionally throughout Illinois, except\nin some of the southern counties (see Distribution\nMap). It is native to Illinois. Habitats include mesic to dry\nblack soil prairies,\nopenings in dry rocky woods, Oak savannas, limestone glades, abandoned\nfields, and open areas along railroads. It is possible that this plant\noccurred in gravel or dolomite prairies before these habitats were\nlargely destroyed by development.\n\n  \n\n  Faunal\nAssociations:\nLong-tongued bees, butterflies, and skippers are the most important\nvisitors to the flowers. Among the long-tongued bees, are such visitors\nas bumblebees, Nomadine cuckoo bees, large carpenter bees, and\nleaf-cutting bees. Short-tongued green metallic bees and other\nHalictine bees also visit the flowers occasionally. The caterpillars of\nthe butterfly Chlosyne nycteis (Silvery\nCheckerspot) feed on the foliage, while caterpillars of the\nmoths Synchlora aerata\n(Wavy-Lined Emerald) and Eupithecia miserulata\n(Common Eupithecia) feed on the flowerheads. Goldfinches occasionally\neat the seeds. Mammalian\nherbivores, particularly livestock, may eat this plant occasionally,\nbut it is not a preferred food source.\n\n  \n\n  Photographic Location:\nThe photographs were taken at the Red Bison Railroad Prairie in Savoy,\nIllinois.\n\n  \n\n  Comments:\nThis plant usually precedes Echinacea purpurea\n(Purple Coneflower) in bloom by about 2-4 weeks. Sometimes their\nflowers are difficult to tell apart, but the leaves of Pale Purple\nConeflower are more long and narrow, hairier, lighter green, and tend\nto remain near the base of the plant.\n\n  Return\n\n  \n\n"
