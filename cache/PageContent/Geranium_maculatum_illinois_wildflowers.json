They\nare up to 5\" long and across, and palmately cleft with 5 deep lobes.\nEach of these lobes is wedge-shaped at the base. The leaf margins have\na few secondary lobes and coarse teeth. The upper pairs of leaves on\nthe\nflowering stems are like\nthe lower leaves, except they are smaller in size and they usually\nhave 3 primary lobes, rather than 5. The upper leaf surface is medium\ngreen with fine appressed hairs. The\nlong petioles of these leaves are light green, terete, and coarsely\nhairy.\nThe flowering stalks (peduncles) are up to 6\" long and ascending\nto erect; like the stems with opposite leaves, they are light\ngreen to reddish brown, terete, and coarsely hairy. \n\n\nEach flowering stalk\nterminates in a floppy corymb or umbel of 2-5 flowers;\nsometimes only a single flower is produced. Each flower is\nabout 1–1�\" across, consisting of 5 rounded petals, 5 green sepals, 10\nstamens with pale yellow anthers, and a single pistil with 5 carpels.\nThe petals are pale purplish pink and obovate with rounded\ntips; they have fine veins radiating across\ntheir surfaces that function as nectar guides. The sepals are light\ngreen, hairy, lanceolate-oblong or elliptic-oblong in shape, and\ncuspidate (tapering abruptly into short narrow tips); they are\nshorter than the petals. Both the flowering stalks\n(peduncles) and pedicels have non-glandular hairs. The blooming period\noccurs during the late spring to early summer, lasting about 1 month.\nThe pistil of the flower elongates into a beak-like fruit about 1–1�\"\nlong. As it matures, the 5 slender carpels of this fruit curl upward\nand backward to fling the seeds from the mother plant. The seed surface\nis reticulated. The root system consists of a\ndark stout rootstock that produces rhizomes; it is high in tannins.\nThis plant often forms colonies.\n\nCultivation:\nThe preference is light shade to partial sunlight, moist to slightly\ndry conditions, and rich loamy soil with abundant organic matter. This\nplant also tolerates full sunlight if there is sufficient moisture in\nthe soil. It is one of the easier woodland\nspecies to cultivate.\n\nRange & Habitat:\nThe native Wild Geranium is a common plant of woodlands that occurs in\nall counties of Illinois (see Distribution\nMap). Habitats include both\nfloodplain and upland woodlands, savannas, meadows in wooded areas,\nsemi-shaded seeps, and rocky glades. Sometimes it invades hill prairies\nfrom adjacent wooded areas. Wild Geranium is a typical species of mesic\ndeciduous woodlands.\n\nFaunal\nAssociations:\nThe nectar and pollen of the flowers attract bumblebees, mason bees (Osmia spp.), cuckoo\nbees (Nomada spp.),\nlong-horned bees (Synhalonia\nspp.), Halictid bees (Lasioglossum\nspp., etc.), Andrenid bees (Andrena spp.), and\nother bees. An Andrenid bee, Andrena\ndistans, is a specialist pollinator (oligolege) of Wild\nGeranium (Geranium\nmaculatum). The flowers also attract Syrphid flies, dance\nflies (Empis spp.),\nbutterflies,\nand skippers. Other insects feed on the leaves and other parts of Wild\nGeranium. This includes leaf-mining larvae of the beetle Pachyschelus\npurpureus, Acyrthosiphon\nmalvae (Geranium Aphid) and\nMacrosiphum\ngeranii (Wild Geranium Aphid), Metriorrhynchomiris dislocatus\n(Yellow Plant Bug), burrowing bugs (Sehirus\nspp.), stink bugs (Euschistus\nspp.), and ebony bugs (Corimelaena\nspp.). The caterpillars of some\nmoths species also feed on Wild Geranium and other Geranium spp.,\nincluding Lacinipolia lorea (Bridled Arches), Heliothis\nvirescens\n(Geranium Budworm Moth, Tobacco Budworm Moth), and Archips purpurana\n(Omnivorous Leafroller Moth). Among vertebrate animals, the Eastern\nChipmunk sometimes eats the\nseeds, while the White-tailed Deer occasionally browses on the foliage.\n\nPhotographic\nLocation:\nA flower garden at Crystal Lake Park in Urbana, Illinois, and Busey\nWoods in the same city.\n\nComments:\nThe Wild Geranium (Geranium\nmaculatum) is the showiest of the native geraniums in\nIllinois with flowers\nat least 1\" across. All of the others are far less showy because they\nhave smaller flowers. There is a European species, Geranium\npratense (Meadow Geranium), with equally large flowers, but\nit has not been observed in the wild in Illinois. This species has a\nsimilar appearance to the Wild Geranium, except that the hairs on its\nflowering stalks and pedicels are sticky-glandular, and its leaves are\nmore divided and finely cut. Another European species, Geranium\nsanguineum (Long-Stalked Geranium), is rarely observed as a\nnaturalized plant in\nIllinois. It has flowers with notched petals and its leaves are smaller\nin size.\n"
