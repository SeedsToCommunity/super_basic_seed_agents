One or more umbel-like clusters of flowers are produced from\nlong peduncles up to 5\" long. These peduncles are light green to light\nreddish green, terete, and hairy. Each umbel-like cluster has about 4-6\nflowers on pedicels up to �\" long. These pedicels are light green to\nlight reddish green, terete, and hairy. At the base of these pedicels,\nthere are several bracts up to �\" long that are light green to dark\nred, lanceolate in shape, and hairy. \n\n  \n\n  Individual\nflowers are about �–�\"\nacross when they are fully open; they can be pistillate, staminate, or\nperfect (staminate flowers are the least common). Each flower has 5\nwhite petals, 5 green sepals, and 5 green sepal-like bracts. The petals\nare oval to orbicular in shape; they are longer than either the sepals\nor sepal-like bracts. The sepals are lanceolate in shape and hairy,\nwhile the sepal-like bracts are linear-lanceolate and hairy; both\nsepals and sepal-like bracts are joined together at the base of the\nflower. Each pistillate flower has a dome-shaped cluster of pistils at\nits center that is greenish yellow or pale yellow. Each staminate\nflower has 20-35\nstamens with pale yellow filaments and yellow anthers.\nEach perfect flower has a dome-shaped cluster of pistils at its center\nand a ring of surrounding stamens. The blooming period occurs from late\nspring to early summer, lasting about 3-4 weeks. Afterwards, the\nflowers are replaced by fruits when growing conditions are favorable,\notherwise they abort. These fruits are up to �\" long and across; they\nare globoid or globoid-ovoid in shape, becoming bright red at\nmaturity. Small\nseeds are scattered across the surface of these fruits in sunken pits;\nthe persistent sepals and sepal-like bracts are appressed to the\nupper surface of these fruits. The fleshy interior of these fruits has\na\nsweet-tart flavor; they are edible. The root system consists of a\nshallow crown with fibrous roots. After the production of flowers and\nfruits, hairy above-ground stolons up to 2' long may develop from the\ncrown. When the tips of these stolons touch the ground, they often\nform plantlets that take root. In this manner, clonal colonies of\nplants often develop.\n\n  \n\n  Cultivation:\nThe preference is full or partial sun, moist to dry-mesic\nconditions, and fertile soil containing loam or clay-loam. Wild\nStrawberry is a cool-season plant that grows actively during the spring\nand fall, but it often becomes dormant after setting fruit during the\nhot summer months. This plant is easy to cultivate, and it will spread\nto form a loose ground cover in open areas. The foliage is more\nresistant to foliar disease than most cultivated strawberries. While\nflowers are produced reliably every spring where there is adequate\nsunlight, the fruits may or may not develop, depending on the weather\nand environmental conditions. Watering plants during dry spells in late\nspring and early summer probably encourages fruits to develop. These\nfruits are much smaller in size than those of cultivated strawberries.\n\n  \n\n  Range & Habitat:\nThe native Wild Strawberry is common in most areas of\nIllinois, although in parts of NW and southern Illinois it is\noccasional or absent (see Distribution\nMap).\nHabitats include black soil prairies, hill prairies, bluegrass\nmeadows, small meadows in wooded areas, open woodlands, woodland\nborders, savannas, limestone glades, roadsides, and areas along\nrailroads. Wild Strawberry is able to tolerate competition from taller\nplants because it develops early in the spring, and it is able to\ntolerate some shade later in the year. This plant occurs in both\ndegraded and high quality habitats, often not far from wooded areas.\n\n  \n\n  Faunal\nAssociations:\nThe ecological value of Wild Strawberry to various insects, birds, and\nanimals is high. The nectar and pollen of the flowers attract little\ncarpenter bees (Ceratina\nspp.), cuckoo bees (Nomada\nspp.), mason bees\n(Osmia spp.),\nHalictid bees (including green metallic bees), Halictid\ncuckoo bees (Sphecodes\nspp.), Andrenid bees, Syrphid flies,\nthick-headed flies (Conopidae), Tachinid flies, bottle flies (Lucilia\nspp.), flesh flies (Sarcophagidae), small butterflies, and\nskippers\n(see Robertson, 1929, & others). These floral visitors are\nbeneficial because they cross-pollinate the flowers. Other insects feed\ndestructively on the foliage and other parts of Wild Strawberry.\nCaterpillars of the Grizzled Skipper (Pyrgus centaurae wyandot)\nfeed on\nthis plant. Other insect feeders include larvae of such moths as the\nStrawberry Crown Borer (Synanthedon\nbibionipennis), Strawberry\nLeafroller Moth (Ancylis\ncomptana fragariae), and Wild Strawberry Seed\nBorer (Grapholita\nangleseana). The Moth Table has a\nmore complete list\nof moth species that feed on this plant. \n\n  \n\n  Other\ninsect feeders include the\nStrawberry Flea Beetle (Altica\nignita) and other leaf beetles\n(Chrysomelidae), the Strawberry Sap Beetle (Stelidota gemmata),\nthe\nStrawberry Root Weevil (Otiorhynchus\novatus) and other weevils\n(Curculionidae), larvae of the Strawberry Reniform Gall Midge\n(Cecidomyia reniformis),\nlarvae of the Strawberry Cylindrical Gall Wasp\n(Diastrophus fragariae),\nlarvae of the Curled Rose Sawfly (Allantus\ncinctus) and other sawflies, the Strawberry Aphid (Chaetosiphon\nfragaefolii) and other aphids,\nand flower thrips. The Insect Table\nhas a\nmore complete\nlist of insect species that feed on this plant. Various vertebrate\nanimals eat the fruits and foliage of Wild Strawberry. Some upland\ngamebirds and songbirds eat the fruits, including the Ring-necked\nPheasant, Brown Thrasher, Eastern Towhee, Veery, and\nAmerican Robin. Some mammals, including the American Black Bear,\nOpossum, Franklin Ground Squirrel, Eastern Chipmunk, and White-footed\nMouse, also eat the fruits, as do the Eastern Box Turtle, Ornate Box\nTurtle, and Wood Turtle. By eating the fruits, these animals spread the\nseeds to new locations. The foliage of Wild Strawberry is a source of\nfood for the Ruffed Grouse and Cottontail Rabbit; it is also browsed by\nhorses, cattle, sheep, and\ngoats. The Wildlife Table has a\nmore complete list of vertebrate\nanimals that feed on this plant.\n\n  \n\n  Photographic\nLocation:\nThe photographs were taken along a roadside near Urbana,\nIllinois; at Dave Monk's postage stamp prairie in Champaign,\nIllinois; and at the wildflower garden of the webmaster in Urbana,\nIllinois.\n\n  \n\n  Comments:\nThis is one of the parent plants for the cultivated strawberry (Fragaria � ananassa).\nThe other parent plant of the cultivated strawberry is the Coastal\nStrawberry (Fragaria\nchiloensis).\nThis latter species is found along the Pacific Coast in both North and\nSouth America. The cultivated strawberry inherited the superior flavor\nof the Wild Strawberry (Fragaria\nvirginiana)\nand the larger fruit size of the Coastal Strawberry. The Wild\nStrawberry produces attractive white flowers during the spring and\nsmall red fruits during the early summer. It is similar in appearance\nto another native species, the Hillside Strawberry (Fragaria vesca americana).\nThe fruits of Hillside Strawberry have sepals and sepal-like bracts\nthat are spreading to reflexed, rather than appressed. The fruits of\nHillside Strawberry also have seeds scattered on top of their surfaces,\nrather than enclosed in shallow pits. This strawberry species is found\nin northern Illinois, where it is uncommon. It is closely related to\nthe Alpine Strawberry (Fragaria\nvesca vesca), which is found in Europe.\n\n  Return\n\n  \n\n"
