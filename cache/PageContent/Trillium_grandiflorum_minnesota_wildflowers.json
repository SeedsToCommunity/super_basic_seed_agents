The petal width varies greatly, from relatively narrow to almost as wide as long. In the center is a group of several yellow stamens. There are 3 green sepals that are shorter and narrower than the petals. Each plant has a single flower at the end of a 2 to 3 inch stalk that rises above the leaves. The flowers turn rosy pink with age.\n\nLeaves:  \n\n A single whorl of 3 leaves is at the top of the stem. Leaves are 3 to 6 inches long and wide, generally oval to egg-shaped with a sharply pointed tip and tapering slightly at the base. Deep veins radiate from the base of the leaf.\n\nNotes:Large-flowered Trillium is the largest Trillium in Minnesota. It is long-lived but slow to mature—it can be several years between the time seed is germinated and the first flower blooms. The seeds are mostly spread by ants, which take the fruit to their underground homes, eat the fruit flesh and leave the seed behind. At one time Trillium was in its own Trilliaceae family, then moved to the Liliaceae (Lily) family, and is now back in its own family, renamed Melanthiaceae.\n\n\nMore photos\n\t\n Large-flowered Trillium plants\n pink flowered plant\n view from the side\n a colony of Large-flowered Trillium\n flower with broad petals\n garden grown Large-flowered Trillium\n\n\nPhotos by K.
