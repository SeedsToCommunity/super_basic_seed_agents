    "textContent": "Commonly called White Trillium, Great White Trillium or Snow Trillium, this plant is a \"must-have\" for any woodland area in the Midwest or Northeast.  Trillium grandiflorum's stunning white flowers can reach 4\" in diameter and will take on an equally head-turning pink hue when reaching the end of their bloom cycle (see corresponding photos for the pink-tinted flowers). \t \tThe common name Wake Robin is less used today, but it no doubt referred to the early April and May bloom time, corresponding with the appearance of the Robin.  Trilliums are members of the Lily family. \t \t It can be difficult to grow from seed.  We are quoting William Cullina of the  New England Wildflower Society and his book Guide to Growing and Propagating Wildflowers: \"Seed that is cleaned and sown immediately outdoors in late summer will send out a root the next spring and a long narrow cotyledon the spring after that.  After a couple more years, the young plant should be large enough to plant in the garden.\" \t  \tCullina gives this germination advice for genus Trillium: \"Seeds germinate only after multiple cycles of warm and cold, typically 40 degrees, 70 degrees, 40, 70.\"*This species may be difficult and/or slow to germinate and grow to maturity. Please note the germination code. Seed of this species is kept under refrigeration (33-38 F) in our warehouse. The days in transit to you in colder or warmer conditions won’t harm the seed, but it should be put back in refrigeration until you are ready to plant or apply pre-sowing treatment.\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLive Plant Shipping Table\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSpring\n\t\t\tFall\n\t\t\tAge/Size\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDormant Bare Roots\n\t\t\tApril-May\n\t\t\tOctober\n\t\t\t2-3 years\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nMap Key\n\n\n\nPresent in state\n\n\n\n\nPresent but introduced in county\n\n\n\n\nPresent and native in county; not rare\n\n\n\n\nNot present in state\n\n\n\n\nPresent and native in county; rare\n\n\n\n\nSpecies extirpated (historic)\n\n\n\n\nState or county listed as noxious\n\n\n\n\nPresent in state; exotic\n\n\nThis map shows the native and introduced (adventive) range of this species.

I’m wondering how it might do in a spot with building shade that gets only indirect light.\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nJuly 5\n\nHI Hans. Or for sure - it will do well even if there is not direct spring-time sun on the plants. I have a few plants in the back of my house (by the air conditioning unit!) that gets no direct sunlight and they bloom. They aren't spreading for now, but I'm hopeful they will as they are only 5 years old\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nMatthew Darling\nApril 6\n\nDo you know if it would be okay to sow this plant now (April) versus later in the summer?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nApril 7\n\nHi Matthew, \n\nFor this species, it is best if you can plant when the seed is fresh, as soon as you can (Germination Code L). Be sure to have patience with this conservative plant; if sowed this spring, the earliest you can expect to see germination is 2 years from now (Germination Code F).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nAnne\nAugust 29\n\nAny idea if this plant can handle occasional  standing water? I’d like to put it in a shade raingarden.\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nAugust 30\n\nHi Anne,\nI have not heard of this plant being used in rain gardens. It may struggle with the fluctuating soil moisture. You could certainly do some experimenting though! Alternatively, you might be interested in this list of shady rain garden plants according to the University of Wisconsin Extension.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeed\nGrowing your own plants from seed is the most economical way to add natives to your home. Before you get started, one of the most important things to know about the seeds of wild plants is that many have built-in dormancy mechanisms that prevent the seed from germinating. In nature, this prevents a population of plants from germinating all at once, before killing frosts, or in times of drought. To propagate native plants, a gardener must break this dormancy before seed will grow.\nEach species is different, so be sure to check the GERMINATION CODE listed on the website, in the catalog, or on your seed packet. Then, follow the GERMINATION INSTRUCTIONS prior to planting. Some species don't need any pre-treatment to germinate, but some species have dormancy mechanisms that must be broken before the seed will germinate. Some dormancy can be broken in a few minutes, but some species take months or even years.\nSeed dormancy can be broken artificially by prolonged refrigeration of damp seed in the process of cold/moist STRATIFICATION. A less complicated approach is to let nature handle the stratifying through a dormant seeding, sowing seeds on the surface of a weed-free site in late fall or winter. Tucked safely beneath the snow, seeds will be conditioned by weathering to make germination possible in subsequent growing seasons.\nTo learn more, please visit: How to Germinate Native Seeds\n\n\nDormant Bare Root Plants\nWe dig plants when they are dormant from our outdoor beds and ship them April-May and October. Some species go dormant in the summer and we can ship them July/August. We are among the few still employing this production method, which is labor intensive but plant-friendly. They arrive to you dormant, with little to no top-growth (bare-root), packed in peat moss. They should be planted as soon as possible. Unlike greenhouse-grown plants, bare-root plants can be planted during cold weather or anytime the soil is not frozen. A root photo is included with each species to illustrate the optimal depth and orientation. Planting instructions/care are also included with each order.\nDownload: Installing Your Bare-Root Plants\n\n\nPotted Plants\n3-packs and trays of 32, 38, or 50 plants leave our Midwest greenhouses based on species readiness (being well-rooted for transit) and order date; Spring shipping is typically early May through June, and Fall shipping is mid-August through September. Plants shipped in spring may be overwintered and still emerging from dormancy. Potted plants are typically 4-9 months old when they ship. Plant tray cells are approximately 2” wide x 5” deep in the trays of 38 and 50, and 2.5\" wide x 3.5\" deep in the 3-packs and trays of 32; ideal for deep-rooted natives. Full-color tags and planting & care instructions are included with each order.\nDownload: Planting and Care of Potted Plants\n\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: we are a mail order nursery and have no retail facilities, but you may pick up your order if prior arrangements are made. Pick up orders are subject to **MN Sales Tax.\nUS Shipping & Handling Charges\nSEED $100.00 and under: $5.00 Retail online SEED orders over $100.00 ship free! Custom seed mixes or discounted seed sales over $100, add 5% of the total seed cost. (for orders over $1,000 a package signature may be required)\nBARE ROOT and POTTED PLANTS $50.00 and under: $9.00 over $50.00: 18% of the total plant cost. (For orders over $1,000 a package signature may be required.)\nTOOLS and BOOKS have the shipping fee included in the cost of the product (within the contiguous US).\n**We are required to collect state sales tax in certain states. Your state's eligibility and % will be calculated at checkout. MN State Sales Tax of 7.375% is applied for orders picked up at our MN location. Shipping & handling charges are also subject to the sales tax.\n\n\nShipping Season\nSEED, TOOLS and BOOKS are sent year-round. Most orders ship within 1-3 business days.\nBARE ROOT PLANTS are shipped during optimal transplanting time: Spring (April-May) and Fall (Oct). Some ephemeral species are also available for summer shipping. Since our plants are field-grown, Nature sets the schedule each year as to when our season will begin and end. We fill all orders, on a first-come, first-serve basis, to the best of our ability depending on weather conditions beyond our control.\nPOTTED PLANTS (Trays of 32/38/50 plugs and 3-packs) typically begin shipping early May and go into June; shipping time is heavily dependent on all the species in your order being well-rooted. If winter-spring greenhouse growing conditions are favorable and all species are well-rooted at once, then we ship by order date (first come, first serve). We are a Midwest greenhouse, and due to the challenges of getting all the species in the Mix & Match and Pre-Designed Garden Kits transit-ready at the same time, we typically can't ship before early May. Earlier shipment requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n*We are unable to ship PLANTS (bare root or potted) outside the contiguous US or to CALIFORNIA due to regulations.\n\n\nDelivery\nWe ship using USPS, UPS and Spee Dee. UPS and Spee Dee are often used for expediting plant orders; they will not deliver to Post Office Box numbers, so please also include your street address if ordering plants. We send tracking numbers to your email address so please include it when you order.\nFOR MORE DETAILED SHIPPING INFORMATION, INCLUDING CANADA SHIPPING RATES (SEED ONLY), PLEASE SEE 'SHIPPING' AT THE FOOTER OF THIS WEBSITE.\n\n"
