The petioles of the alternate leaves are\nup to 3\" long and they are often winged, particularly where the\npetioles join the stem. \n\n\nThe upper central stem of each plant (and any\nupper lateral stems) terminates in a flat-headed panicle (corymb) of\nflowerheads spanning 3-8\" across. Individual flowerheads are �-1�\"\nacross, consisting of 8-20 ray florets that surround numerous disk\nflorets. The petal-like corollas of the ray florets are lavender or\nwhite. The tubular corollas of the disk florets are initially\npale\nyellow or yellow, but they later become orange-red, dark red, or brown.\nThe tubular corolla of each disk floret has 5 slightly spreading lobes\nat its apex. At the base of each flowerhead, there are numerous floral\nbracts (phyllaries) that are arranged in 4-6 series; they are appressed\nand overlapping. Individual floral bracts are more or less oblong\nin shape and mostly green, except for the narrow white margins along\ntheir sides; they are short-pubescent and occasionally ciliate along\ntheir margins. The tips of these bracts are usually blunt; less often,\nthey are somewhat pointed. The peduncles and pedicels of the panicle\nare light green, relatively stout, and covered with short glandular\nhairs. At the base of each branch of the panicle, there is usually a\nsingle leafy bract up to 1�\" long\nthat is broadly oblong or broadly elliptic; these bracts\nare sessile. \n\n\nThe blooming period occurs from\nlate summer to early fall and lasts about 1-1� months. During the\nautumn, both ray and disk florets are replaced by small bullet-shaped\nachenes; each achene has a tuft of tawny hairs at its apex. The achenes\nare distributed by the wind. The root system is fibrous and\nlong-rhizomatous; on older plants, a small caudex sometimes develops.\nThis wildflower often forms clonal colonies by means of the spreading\nrhizomes.\n\nCultivation:\nThe preference is partial sun to medium\nshade, moist to dry-mesic conditions, and soil consisting of rich\nloam or sandy loam.Range\n& Habitat: The native Big-Leaved\nAster is found only in the northeast section of Illinois, where it is\nrare. This species is more common in areas that lie\nto the north or east of the state. Habitats consist of beech-maple\nwoodlands, sandy oak woodlands, sandy oak savannas, elevated areas\n(hummocks) in swamps, stabilized sand dunes where oak trees are\ndominant, and woodland borders. Usually, Big-Leaved Aster occupies\nhigh-quality natural areas that are more or less mesic (neither too dry\nnor too wet) and relatively little-disturbed by human activities.\n\nFaunal\nAssociations: The nectar and pollen of the flowers attract\na large\nvariety of insects, including long-tongued bees, short-tongued bees,\nwasps, flies, butterflies, beetles, and plant bugs. An oligolectic\nAndrenid bee, Andrena\nhirticincta, has been observed visiting the\nflowerheads of Big-Leaved Aster (see Graenicher). Other insects feed on\nthe foliage and flowers, suck plant juices, or bore through the\nstems and roots of this aster and others. Examples of such insect\nfeeders include caterpillars of the butterflies Chlosyne nycteis\n(Silvery Checkerspot) and Phyciodes\ntharos (Pearl Crescent); also the caterpillars of\nCarmenta\ncorni (Aster Borer Moth),\nCucullia asteroides\n(The Asteroid), Schinia\narcigera (Arcigera Flower\nMoth), and other moths feed on asters (see Moth Table). Other\ninsects\nfeeders include the larvae of Calycomyza\nhumeralis (Aster Leafminer\nFly), several aphids (mostly Uroleucon\nspp.), Macrosteles\nquadrilineatus (Aster Leafhopper), the lace bugs Corythucha marmorata\nand Galeata spinifrons,\nthe leaf beetles Exema\ncanadensis and\nOphraella\npilosa, the plant bug Plagiognathus\ncuneatus, and others (see Insect\nTable for a more complete listing of species). Some\nvertebrate animals\nuse asters as a food source. The Ruffed Grouse and Wild Turkey eat the\nseeds and foliage, while the White-Tailed Deer and Cottontail Rabbit\nsometimes browse on the foliage. The foliage is also\nedible to cattle, sheep, and other domesticated farm animals.\n\nPhotographic\nLocation: The\nphotograph of the basal leaves was taken at a deciduous woodland in NW\nOhio, while the photographs of the flowerheads were taken at a woodland\nborder and a sandy oak savanna in the Indiana Dunes State\nPark, NW Indiana.\n\n\nComments:\nSometimes Big-Leaved Aster is referred to as\nAster macrophyllus.\nThe large basal leaves of this aster are very\nconspicuous during the spring. During the autumn, Big-Leaved Aster\nresembles many other woodland asters and it is more difficult to\nidentify. However, it can be distinguished from similar species by the\nappearance of its floral bracts (phyllaries), the presence of\nshort glandular hairs on its peduncles and pedicels (a 10x hand lens\nmay be required), and the flat-headed characteristic of its panicles.\nMost asters have elongated panicles of flowerheads that are not\nflat-headed. A species that is not found in Illinois, Eurybia\ndivaricata (White Wood Aster), shares this flat-headed\ncharacteristic\nwith Big-Leaved Aster and its leaves have a similar shape.\nHowever, White Wood Aster has flowerheads with fewer ray florets (about\n5-10), its peduncles and pedicels usually have non-glandular hairs,\nand its basal leaves are smaller in size.\n"
