See the glossary for icon descriptions.\nDetailed Information\n\n\nFlower: \n\n A single flower is at the end of a naked stem growing directly from the ground. Each flower typically has 8 to 10 white petals, but double flowers sometimes occur. The petals have many parallel veins and often 4 of the petals are longer than the others. In the center is a cluster of many golden yellow-tipped stamens. A flower blooms for only a day or two before dying.\n\nLeaves and stem:   \n\n Leaves are basal and lobed in 3 to 9 parts, generally round in outline, up to 5 inches long and wide with a deep indent at the base. The leaf edges are scalloped or have large rounded teeth. A leaf initially wraps around the flower stalk but opens up and reaches full size when the flower wilts, its stem elongating several inches. Leaf and flower stems both are round and smooth with a reddish tint.\n\nFruit: \n Fruit is a spindle-shaped capsule about 1 inch long, containing 10 to 15 seeds.\n\nNotes:Bloodroot is one of the harbingers of spring, sometimes emerging while snow is still on the ground, and is a welcome sight after a long Minnesota winter. A red juice bleeds from broken stems, leaves and roots, and is where the common name originates.\n\n\nMore photos\n\t\n Bloodroot plants\n budding Bloodroot\n more plants\n Bloodroot seeds\n atypical double flowers\n Bloodroot with White Trout Lily and a bit of snow\n\n\nPhotos by K.
