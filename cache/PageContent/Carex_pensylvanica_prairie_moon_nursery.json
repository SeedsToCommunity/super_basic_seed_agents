    "textContent": "Carex pensylvanica is a fine-textured Sedge that reproduces by rhizomes and rarely reaches heights of more than 8\" when blooming. It is sought-after for its look of a traditional lawn and for its dry-soil tolerance and ability to grow in full sun or full shade. To get a solid stand of this hardy sedge that so many desire, divide plants over the years  It will spread between 3-8\" each year depending on the soil moisture of the site. To start a larger area from seed is not realistic; seed is difficult and slow to germinate. Pennsylvania Sedge actively grows during the spring and fall when soil temperatures are cool.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLive Plant Shipping Table\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSpring\n\t\t\tFall\n\t\t\tAge/Size\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDormant Bare Roots\n\t\t\tApril-MayOctober\n\t\t\t1-2 years\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPotted 3-Packs\n\t\t\tApril-JuneAugust-September\n\t\t\t2.5\" wide x 3.5\" deep pots\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPotted Trays of 50\n\t\t\tApril-June\n\t\t\tAugust-September2\" wide x 5\" deep plugs\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nMap Key\n\n\n\nPresent in state\n\n\n\n\nPresent but introduced in county\n\n\n\n\nPresent and native in county; not rare\n\n\n\n\nNot present in state\n\n\n\n\nPresent and native in county; rare\n\n\n\n\nSpecies extirpated (historic)\n\n\n\n\nState or county listed as noxious\n\n\n\n\nPresent in state; exotic\n\n\nThis map shows the native and introduced (adventive) range of this species.

I grow lots of seeds-is this harder than other carex?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nDecember 3\n\nYes, seed propagation for Carex pensylvanica is more challenging than other Carex species due to a combination of low seed set and low germination rates. Vegetative propagation is the standard in the horticultural industry which is most commonly achieved by root divisions. \n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nDebbie\nJuly 21\n\nWill this grow in between the roots of trees (sycamore, oak, maples)?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nJuly 22\n\nHi Debbie,\nYes, Penn Sedge should grow just fine among tree roots.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nCharles\nAugust 13\n\nHi, I was wondering, if you think Carex Pennsylvania can handle road / parking lot salt. Thank you\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nAugust 16\n\nHi Charles,\nThere are no guarantees when dealing with poor-quality runoff, but yes, Carex pensylvanica is fairly salt tolerant. Searching \"salt\" on our website brings up a list of salt tolerant species!\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nmar\nDecember 27\n\nWill carex grow under semi-shade of hemlock?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nDecember 30\n\nCarex pensylvanica should grow fine under semi-shade conditions near hemlocks. \n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nMaggie\nMay 13\n\nWill this sedge tolerate moderate to high foot traffic?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nMay 15\n\nThis sedge will only tolerate light foot traffic.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nKen\nJune 19\n\nIs this sedge a host plant or of interest to insects?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nJune 20\n\nHi Ken. Several types of leafhoppers, grasshoppers, and grass-miner moth larvae will consume Pennsylvania Sedge.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nBob Gilbert\nAugust 30\n\nIs it deer resistant?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nAugust 31\n\nHello Bob,\n\nYes, this plant is deer resistant.\n\nIn the details section of each species page, we mark if a species is deer resistant in the \"Advantages\".\n\nPlease feel free to also take advantage of our search filters, where you can filter for deer resistant species.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\nKathy\nNovember 22\n\nDoes car ex pensylvanica tolerate being mowed?\n\n\n\nA\n\nPrairie Moon\nNovember 25\n\nHello Kathy, There was some research into the tolerance levels of certain carex species and their shade, sun mowing and moisture level tolerance from Mt Cuba Center. This species can tolerate mowings in both shady and sunny areas. That information can be found HERE. I hope this helps!\n\n\n\n\n\nSeed\nGrowing your own plants from seed is the most economical way to add natives to your home. Before you get started, one of the most important things to know about the seeds of wild plants is that many have built-in dormancy mechanisms that prevent the seed from germinating. In nature, this prevents a population of plants from germinating all at once, before killing frosts, or in times of drought. To propagate native plants, a gardener must break this dormancy before seed will grow.\nEach species is different, so be sure to check the GERMINATION CODE listed on the website, in the catalog, or on your seed packet. Then, follow the GERMINATION INSTRUCTIONS prior to planting. Some species don't need any pre-treatment to germinate, but some species have dormancy mechanisms that must be broken before the seed will germinate. Some dormancy can be broken in a few minutes, but some species take months or even years.\nSeed dormancy can be broken artificially by prolonged refrigeration of damp seed in the process of cold/moist STRATIFICATION. A less complicated approach is to let nature handle the stratifying through a dormant seeding, sowing seeds on the surface of a weed-free site in late fall or winter. Tucked safely beneath the snow, seeds will be conditioned by weathering to make germination possible in subsequent growing seasons.\nTo learn more, please visit: How to Germinate Native Seeds\n\n\nDormant Bare Root Plants\nWe dig plants when they are dormant from our outdoor beds and ship them April-May and October. Some species go dormant in the summer and we can ship them July/August. We are among the few still employing this production method, which is labor intensive but plant-friendly. They arrive to you dormant, with little to no top-growth (bare-root), packed in peat moss. They should be planted as soon as possible. Unlike greenhouse-grown plants, bare-root plants can be planted during cold weather or anytime the soil is not frozen. A root photo is included with each species to illustrate the optimal depth and orientation. Planting instructions/care are also included with each order.\nDownload: Installing Your Bare-Root Plants\n\n\nPotted Plants\n3-packs and trays of 32, 38, or 50 plants leave our Midwest greenhouses based on species readiness (being well-rooted for transit) and order date; Spring shipping is typically early May through June, and Fall shipping is mid-August through September. Plants shipped in spring may be overwintered and still emerging from dormancy. Potted plants are typically 4-9 months old when they ship. Plant tray cells are approximately 2” wide x 5” deep in the trays of 38 and 50, and 2.5\" wide x 3.5\" deep in the 3-packs and trays of 32; ideal for deep-rooted natives. Full-color tags and planting & care instructions are included with each order.\nDownload: Planting and Care of Potted Plants\n\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: we are a mail order nursery and have no retail facilities, but you may pick up your order if prior arrangements are made. Pick up orders are subject to **MN Sales Tax.\nUS Shipping & Handling Charges\nSEED $100.00 and under: $5.00 Retail online SEED orders over $100.00 ship free! Custom seed mixes or discounted seed sales over $100, add 5% of the total seed cost. (for orders over $1,000 a package signature may be required)\nBARE ROOT and POTTED PLANTS $50.00 and under: $9.00 over $50.00: 18% of the total plant cost. (For orders over $1,000 a package signature may be required.)\nTOOLS and BOOKS have the shipping fee included in the cost of the product (within the contiguous US).\n**We are required to collect state sales tax in certain states. Your state's eligibility and % will be calculated at checkout. MN State Sales Tax of 7.375% is applied for orders picked up at our MN location. Shipping & handling charges are also subject to the sales tax.\n\n\nShipping Season\nSEED, TOOLS and BOOKS are sent year-round. Most orders ship within 1-3 business days.\nBARE ROOT PLANTS are shipped during optimal transplanting time: Spring (April-May) and Fall (Oct). Some ephemeral species are also available for summer shipping. Since our plants are field-grown, Nature sets the schedule each year as to when our season will begin and end. We fill all orders, on a first-come, first-serve basis, to the best of our ability depending on weather conditions beyond our control.\nPOTTED PLANTS (Trays of 32/38/50 plugs and 3-packs) typically begin shipping early May and go into June; shipping time is heavily dependent on all the species in your order being well-rooted. If winter-spring greenhouse growing conditions are favorable and all species are well-rooted at once, then we ship by order date (first come, first serve). We are a Midwest greenhouse, and due to the challenges of getting all the species in the Mix & Match and Pre-Designed Garden Kits transit-ready at the same time, we typically can't ship before early May. Earlier shipment requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n*We are unable to ship PLANTS (bare root or potted) outside the contiguous US or to CALIFORNIA due to regulations.\n\n\nDelivery\nWe ship using USPS, UPS and Spee Dee. UPS and Spee Dee are often used for expediting plant orders; they will not deliver to Post Office Box numbers, so please also include your street address if ordering plants. We send tracking numbers to your email address so please include it when you order.\nFOR MORE DETAILED SHIPPING INFORMATION, INCLUDING CANADA SHIPPING RATES (SEED ONLY), PLEASE SEE 'SHIPPING' AT THE FOOTER OF THIS WEBSITE.\n\n"
