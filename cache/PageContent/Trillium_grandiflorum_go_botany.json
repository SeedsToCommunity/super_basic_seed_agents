It also has an exceptionally long-lived flower, remaining open and fertile for two to three weeks. This has been shown to increase the probability of visitation by the large long-tongued bees (Bombus) that are its most effective pollinators. The roots of white wakerobin were used for medicinal purposes by several Native American tribes. Occasional stripes or markings on the petals are attributed to infection with mycoplasma (parasitic bacteria).\n                \n            \n        \n\n        \n            Habitat\n            \n              \n              \n                Forests, talus and rocky slopes\n              \n              \n            \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n                New England distribution\n                Adapted from BONAP\n                data\n\n\n                \n                \n\n                \n                    Native: indigenous.\n                    Non-native: introduced\n                    (intentionally or\n                    unintentionally); has become naturalized.\n                    County documented: documented\n                    to exist in the county by\n                    evidence (herbarium specimen, photograph).
