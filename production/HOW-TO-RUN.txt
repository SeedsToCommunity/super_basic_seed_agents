PRODUCTION BATCH PROCESSOR - HOW TO RUN
=======================================

BASIC USAGE
-----------

Run from the project root directory:

    node production/run-batch.js "<sheet-name>" <species-list-file>

Example:

    node production/run-batch.js "Presentation_2026" production/species-list-presentation.txt


WHAT IT DOES
------------

1. Looks for a Google Sheet with the exact name you provide in the output folder
2. If found: reads which species are already in the sheet and skips them
3. If not found: creates a new sheet with that name
4. Processes each species and saves immediately to the sheet
5. Safe to interrupt at any time - progress is saved after each species


RESUMING AFTER INTERRUPTION
---------------------------

Just run the same command again:

    node production/run-batch.js "Presentation_2026" production/species-list-presentation.txt

The script will:
- Find the existing sheet
- Check which species are already there
- Continue with the remaining species


SPECIES LIST FILE FORMAT
------------------------

One species per line, with genus and species separated by space:

    Echinacea pallida
    Echinacea purpurea
    Zizia aurea

See production/species-list-presentation.txt for an example.


CREATING A NEW SPECIES LIST
---------------------------

1. Create a new text file in the production folder
2. Add one species per line (genus followed by species)
3. Run the batch script with your new file


ESTIMATED TIME
--------------

Each species takes approximately 4-5 minutes to process.
52 species = approximately 4-5 hours total.

If running in multiple sessions, progress is preserved between runs.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

"Folder not found" error:
    Check that the output folder name in config/config.json matches your Google Drive folder.

"Google Drive not connected" error:
    The Google Drive integration needs to be reconnected in Replit.

Script stops unexpectedly:
    Just run the same command again to resume from where it stopped.
