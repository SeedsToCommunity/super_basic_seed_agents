## Prompt Guidance

**Purpose:** Dry refrigeration storage for maintaining viability without breaking dormancy (weeks to one season).

- Describe sealed container use (glass jars, airtight plastic containers).
- Do not recommend paper containers (fridge humidity damages seeds).
- Do not recommend desiccants or moisture absorbers.
- Seeds must be thoroughly dried before sealing—unless this species cannot tolerate drying.
- If this species is recalcitrant (loses viability when dried), state that dry fridge storage is not appropriate and suggest alternatives.
- This is storage only—not stratification. Avoid moist media or dormancy-breaking context.
