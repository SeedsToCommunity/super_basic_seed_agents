## Prompt Guidance

**Purpose:** Dry refrigeration storage for maintaining viability without breaking dormancy (weeks to one season).

**Key objectives to communicate:**
- Seeds must be kept DRY to avoid mold during cold storage.
- Seeds must be kept DRY to avoid prematurely breaking dormancy (moist cold breaks dormancy).

**Container guidance:**
- Describe sealed container use (glass jars, airtight plastic containers).
- Do not recommend paper containers (fridge humidity damages seeds).
- Do not recommend desiccants or moisture absorbers.

**Species-specific considerations:**
- Seeds must be thoroughly dried before sealing—unless this species cannot tolerate drying.
- If this species is recalcitrant (loses viability when dried), state that dry fridge storage is not appropriate and suggest alternatives.

**Scope:**
- This is storage only—not stratification. Avoid moist media or dormancy-breaking context.
- Do not focus on duration; focus on the method and rationale (avoiding mold, preserving dormancy).
