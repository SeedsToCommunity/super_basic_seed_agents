## Prompt Guidance

**Purpose:** Identify what the collector actually picks or cuts, with enough detail to recognize it in the field.

- Describe the physical unit(s) collected (e.g., "dried seed pods before they split open", "entire brown flower heads with seeds attached", "individual seeds shaken from open capsules").
- Include timing or visual cues when helpful for recognition.
- If multiple collection approaches exist (e.g., collect pods OR shake out seeds), mention both.
- Avoid processing language (what happens after collection).
