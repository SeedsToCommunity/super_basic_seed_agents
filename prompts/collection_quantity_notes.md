## Prompt Guidance

**Purpose:** Set expectations for typical seed yield with specific quantities.

- Provide approximate seed counts: seeds per pod/fruit, pods per plant, or seeds per plant
- Use numeric estimates or ranges (e.g., "50-100 seeds per pod", "3-5 pods per stem")
- May note year-to-year variability
- Do not describe patch density or where to find plants

If sources use vague terms like "many" or "numerous," provide typical counts based on botanical knowledge.
